2013,Advocate Health and Hospitals Corporation,IL,Theft,Laptop,"In the largest HIPAA enforcement settlement to date, federal regulators have smacked Chicago-based Advocate Health Care with a $5.55 million fine in the wake of an investigation into three 2013 breaches. The largest incident, involving four stolen unencrypted computers, affected about 4 million individuals.

 ""This significant settlement, the largest to-date against a single entity, is a result of the extent and duration of the alleged noncompliance - dating back to the inception of the [HIPAA] Security Rule in some instances - the involvement of the state attorney general in a corresponding investigation, and the large number of individuals whose information was affected by Advocate, one of the largest health systems in the country,"" the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights says in an Aug. 4 statement.
 
 OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels notes: ""We hope this settlement sends a strong message to covered entities that they must engage in a comprehensive risk analysis and risk management to ensure that individuals' ePHI is secure. This includes implementing physical, technical and administrative security measures sufficient to reduce the risks to ePHI in all physical locations and on all portable devices to a reasonable and appropriate level.""
 
 OCR says its latest enforcement action, which includes a detailed corrective action plan, follows its investigation launched after Advocate, which operates 12 hospitals and numerous clinics, submitted three breach notification reports pertaining to separate incidents involving its subsidiary, Advocate Medical Group.
 Reasons for Big Fine
 
 Privacy attorney Kirk Nahra of the law firm Wiley Rein says that while the settlement appears to focus on compliance issues, such as failure to conduct risk analysis, that are frequently highlighted by the enforcement agency, the OCR breach investigations likely uncovered egregious violations.
 
 ""OCR is - and has been historically - both reasonable and knowledgeable,"" he says. ""They seem to know when people are trying hard and when they are not. Going through their cases - and I don't see anything here to indicate this [Advocate case] is different - 'extent and duration' matters a lot, as does not fixing existing problems.""
 
 Privacy attorney David Holtzman, vice president of compliance at the security consultancy CynergisTek, says every OCR resolution agreement is a negotiated settlement in which any number of factors can influence the outcome. ""A significant factor in the size of the payment to settle the allegations with OCR is the length of time in which OCR found that Advocate had not met the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule, as well as their apparent ample financial resources allowing them to absorb the cost of such a penalty,"" he says.
 
 ""What I see as important are the allegations that Advocate health system had not met the HIPAA Security Rule requirements established in 2005 to perform an enterprisewide information security risk assessment or put into place a program designed to reasonably safeguard protected health information across its organization,"" Holtzman says.
 
 Privacy attorney Adam Greene of the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine says the settlement offers important lessons: ""The top three takeaways for me from this settlement are: The bigger the entity, the bigger the settlement, with OCR steadily increasing the settlement amount it is seeking to impose on large covered entities; covered entities have had over a decade to come into compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule; ... and OCR continues to focus on the importance of a risk analysis.""
 OCR's 10th Settlement This Year
 
 The settlement with Advocate is OCR's tenth enforcement action so far in 2016, keeping the agency on a roll in issuing a record number of HIPAA enforcement actions (see 2016 Watershed Year for HIPAA Enforcement).
 
 This latest fine brings the total penalties levied by OCR this year to about $20.5 million, more than in any previous year.
 
 ""At this point, we have a record number of settlements in 2016, and a record-breaking settlement amount, with over four months remaining in the year,"" Greene notes. ""I expect that we will continue to see an increased number of settlements over the coming years, although there may be a lull in the beginning of 2017 as the administration changes.""
 
 Nahra adds: ""You could certainly read into the last few months of HIPAA activity and say both that the pace of enforcement is increasing and that OCR is being less tolerant of significant violations. I don't see any overall change at the biggest picture level - they still tend to be reasonable, and appreciate strong efforts at compliance, even if something doesn't work.""
 
 The message to HIPAA covered entities and business associates from the latest enforcement activities, Nahra says, is: ""OCR is out there, is active, and can tell if you aren't doing a good job. It makes sense to re-evaluate and re-examine your compliance approach, even if you haven't had real problems before.""
 The Three Breaches
 
 The three Advocate breaches exposed a variety of demographic, clinical and health insurance information, as well as credit card numbers. The largest of the incidents involved the theft of four unencrypted computers in July 2013 from an office of Advocate Medical Group in Illinois.
 
 OCR notes that the two other breaches reported in 2013 leading to the settlement included:
 
  A breach involving Blackhawk Consulting Group, a business associate which provides billing services to Advocate. Advocate reported that the ePHI of 2,027 patients had been potentially compromised when an unauthorized third party accessed Blackhawk's network.
  The theft of an unencrypted laptop containing the ePHI of approximately 2,237 individuals from an Advocate workforce member's vehicle.
 
 OCR says the investigations into the three incidents revealed that Advocate failed to:
 
  Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to all of its ePHI;
  Implement policies and procedures and facility access controls to limit physical access to the electronic information systems housed within a large data support center;
  Obtain satisfactory assurances in the form of a written business associate contract that its business associate would appropriately safeguard all ePHI in its possession;
  Reasonably safeguard an unencrypted laptop when left in an unlocked vehicle overnight.
 
 Corrective Actions Mandated
 
 As part of the resolution agreement, Advocate has agreed to a corrective action plan that calls for:
 
  Conducting a comprehensive and thorough risk analysis and implementing a risk management plan;
  Implementing processes for evaluating environmental and operational changes that affect the security of ePHI in Advocate's possession or control;
  Developing a report on its encryption status;
  Revising policies and procedures on device and media controls as well as limiting physical access to all of its electronic information;
  Revising policies and procedures related to business associates; and
  Developing an enhanced privacy and security awareness training program.
 
 In a statement provided to Information Security Media Group, Advocate says: ""Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of our patients while delivering the highest level of care and service are our top priorities. As all industries deal with the ever-evolving digital landscape and the impact it has on security, we've enhanced our data encryption measures to prevent this type of incident from reoccurring. While there continues to be no indication that the information was misused, we deeply regret any inconvenience this incident has caused our patients. We continue to cooperate fully with the government to advance our patient privacy protection efforts.""

2013,"Advocate Health Care , Advocate Medical Group",IL,STAT,Other,"Personal information for more than 4 million patients of Advocate Medical Group may be at risk after four computers were stolen in a July 15 burglary of an administrative building in Park Ridge, Advocate said Friday.
 
 The information includes names, addresses, Social Security numbers and dates of birth, but no medical records or personal financial information, of patients seen by doctors affiliated with the medical group from the early 1990s through July, said Kelly Jo Golson, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Downers Grove-based Advocate Health Care.
 
 Advocate on Friday afternoon began sending letters to the patients affected, a process that will continue through Sept. 9, Golson said. Advocate is offering a free year of credit monitoring services to those whose information may have been exposed.
 
 Advocate Medical Group is the region’s largest physician group with more than 1,000 doctors and 200 locations, mostly in and around Chicagoland and Central Illinois. It is part of Advocate Health Care, the region’s largest hospital chain with 12 hospitals, including Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn and Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge. Only patients of the medical group were affected, Golson said.
 
 While the desktop computers were password protected, they were not encrypted, Golson said.
 
 ""Nothing leads us to believe the computers were taken for the information they contain, and there is no information to suggest any of that data has been used in an inappropriate way,"" Golson said. ""We want our patients to know that security is a top priority, and we’re focused right now on putting together resources to make sure we can help answer any questions.""
 
 Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy at nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an advocate for consumers' privacy rights, called the incident ""a very significant breach."" The information could be used to open credit cards or even open cell phone accounts in the names of those patients, he said.
 
 ""Password protection is worthless,"" said Stephens, who said simply removing a hard drive and attaching it to another device would surmount that obstacle.
 
 Stephens said affected patients may want to place a fraud alert on their credit report by contacting any one of the three major credit reporting agencies. The alerts expire after 90 days but can be renewed.
 
 Any fraudulent activity, he said, could take up to a month to surface on a credit report, but credit inquiries would surface right away. Patients should immediately order a free credit report from all three credit agencies, Stephens said.
 
 Such information can be sold to an underground market of identity thieves in Europe, Stephens said, and may not be used for months or years.
 
 The incident occurred in the early morning hours of July 15 at Advocate’s 70,000 square-foot administrative offices on West Touhy Ave. The building was not equipped with an alarm, but it had a security camera and a panic button, Golson said. Advocate has since installed continuous security staffing at the office and is re-evaluating its security systems and practices systemwide.
 
 Advocate informed the Park Ridge Police Department immediately, and Golson said it continues to work with investigators. The computers have not been recovered. Park Ridge Police officials did not return a call seeking comment.
 
 When asked why patients weren’t notified until more than a month after the computers were stolen, Golson said Advocate officials had to determine the extent of the data potentially exposed.
 
 ""There was a large volum“e data on the computers and the format of the data was very complex,"" Golson said. ""We were very comprehensive and thorough in our analysis of the data to ensure we were notifying every patient who may be affected.""
 
 The Illinois Attorney General's Office is looking into the matter, but has yet to determine whether it will take any legal action, a spokeswoman said.
 
 Craig Spiezle, executive director of Online Trust Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group, said companies should have data response plans in place to prevent such lag times. Such plans, he said, ensure that if a breach occurs, a company can act immediately because it knows exactly which data is stored where at all times.
 
 That lag time also means any potential identity thieves have had a five-week window to use the data, said Stephens at the privacy rights advocacy group. Credit monitoring would not identify breaches that occurred in the past but that information would surface on a credit report, Stephens said.
 
 After the extent of the information potentially exposed became clear, Advocate notified the federal Health and Human Services Department and its Office of Human Rights, the Illinois Attorney General, some insurance companies and a handful of elected officials.
 
 Worldwide, 2,644 data breaches were reported in 2012, more than double the 2011 figure, according to the Online Trust Alliance.
 
 In Illinois last year, at least 31 institutions reported data breaches, up by about 30 percent from the prior year and on par with 2010, according to a Tribune analysis of records complied by the nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. So far this year, at least 10 breaches have been reported in the state, including an April hacking incident at Morningstar Document Research that may have compromised certain data for 182,000 customers. Morningstar notified clients of the breach in July.
 
 Data breaches are increasingly common and under-reported by as much as 50 percent, said Spiezle.
 
 ""People seem to think this is something just happens online where someone hacks in and gets the data. We’re seeing more and more instances where it's -– the employee’s computer was stolen from a car. Physical theft,” he said.
 
 Advocate has set up temporary call centers to handle patient inquiries, as well as a web site that went live Friday afternoon, www.patientnotice.org.
 
 The Illinois Attorney General’s office said consumers whose data may have been compromised should call its identity theft hotline at 866-999-5630.",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,40.0,4000000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2010,Advocate Health Care,IL,Theft,Laptop,"Advocate Data Breach – Different Year, Same Encryption Problems
 In many respects, it has been The Summer of The Data Breach. HHS brought down the hammer on Wellpoint, fining the insurer $1.7 million after discovering the impermissible disclosure of over 600,000 patient records through an unsecured online application. A couple of weeks later OHSU reported a breach of over 3,000 patient records when hospital officials learned that providers were using Google Drive to share patient records in the cloud. Finally, just two weeks ago in the event that sent shock waves through both covered entities and business associates, OCR and Affinity reached a $1.2 million settlement after the health plan failed to delete over 300,000 patient records off a digital photocopier it had leased in 2010. A subsequent lessee, CBS, noticed a large amount of leftover sensitive data.
 An Unfortunate Healthcare Breach
 So, in what can only be described as a suitable event to close out the summer, this Labor Day weekend punctuated this series of noteworthy PHI events with the discovery that Advocate Health lost more than 4 million patient records after a thief stole four computers from the largest Illinois medical group. In an all too familiar fact pattern, the laptops were not encrypted and left every data record vulnerable to compromise.
 While the number of compromised patient records is staggering, the biggest shocker of all was that Advocate has dealt with this exact problem in the past. In a 2009 laptop theft, Advocate landed itself on the OCR “Wall of Shame” for the breach which caused 812 patient records to walk out of the door with their thief. In a settlement with federal regulators stemming from this first incident, Advocate agreed to launch an encryption program to protect all future mobile devices from third party access even if stolen. An Advocate spokeswoman indicated that this encryption program had not yet reached the four recently stolen laptops.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,812.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2013,AHMC Healthcare INC and affiliated Hospitals,CA,Theft,Laptop,"March 13, 2014 - About 729,000 patients’ data may have been compromised because two password-protected laptops with their data were stolen on October 12 from AHMC Healthcare Inc.’s administrative offices.
 
 Editor’s note: There has been an update to this story. Christopher Lee Brown was sentenced to 4 years and 8 months in prison on charges of second-degree burglary and receiving stolen property, according to the Pasadena Star News. Surveillance footage was used by Alhambra police to identify Brown and he was arrested on October 23.
 
 The Los Angeles Times reports that the breach affected patients under Medicare who received care at the six hospitals owned by AHMC Healthcare Inc. Affected AHMC patients were treated at Garfield Medical Center, Monterey Park Hospital, Greater El Monte Community Hospital, Whittier Hospital Medical Center, San Gabriel Valley Medical Center and Anaheim Regional Medical Center.
 
 About 10 percent of Medicare patients had their Social Security numbers compromised, while the laptops also included patient names, Medicare/insurance identification numbers, diagnosis/procedure codes, and insurance/patient payments. The laptops had been guarded and gated by a security team with video surveillance, but the thieves broke into the office and stole the laptops.

 AHMC Healthcare Inc. learned of the breach on October 14 and though it doesn’t believe that any information had been accessed inappropriately, it didn’t rule out the possibility of foul play with the data.
 
 The Times also reports that AHMC had already asked an auditing firm to perform a security risk assessment. And it will finally accomplish what it should have been doing already by expediting an encryption policy for all laptops. “We regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause our patients,” it said in the statement.

2006,Akron Children's Hospital,OH,HACK,Other,"Hackers broke into the systems of an Ohio hospital last month raising fears that the personal details of up to 230,000 patients or their family members, and banking information on around 12,000 financial donors, might have been compromised.
 
 News of the attack came after Akron Children's Hospital began notifying families last week, around seven weeks after the security breach was identified.
 
 The attack came as the hospital upgraded its systems. It's unclear whether or not data obtained by the hackers was subsequently abused to conduct ID theft or other scams.
 
 In a statement on the attack, the hospital said external security consultants ""have found no evidence that any specific data was downloaded, tampered with, or compromised; however, the opportunity to view the data existed"".
 
 The breach was discovered on 6 September but hospital officials failed to contact FBI investigators until 20 October, according to US reports. Security consultants initially told the hospital that the breach wasn't significant and it wasn't until the full scale of the problem became apparent that the Feds were called. Notification to potential victims didn't begin until another expert compiled a list of possible marks.
 
 The hospital said it had beefed up its security defences to guard against future attacks.
 
 The attack is the latest of a series of attacks against US organisations that have exposed people's personal or financial information over the last two years. According to the Identity Theft Resource Centre, there were 151 such incidents across the US last year, potentially exposing the details of more than 57.7m people. ®",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,44.0,242000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2009,Akron Children's Hospital,OH,HACK,Other,"If you ever had the urge to download one of those software programs that lets you spy on someone else's computer, consider first the case of
 
 Scott Graham of Avon Lake.
 
 Early last year, Graham, a cardiac surgical technician at University Hospitals in Cleveland, wanted to sneak a peek at the online activity of a woman he knew.
 
 So he sent an e-mail to her personal Yahoo! account with an attachment that would unleash spyware when opened.
 
 The spyware, legally purchased on the Internet, was designed to capture e-mails and screen shots from the infected computer and forward them to a stealth e-mail account Graham could peruse without anyone knowing.
 
 But Graham got more than he expected when the woman, an employee of Akron Children's Hospital, opened the e-mail attachment on her work computer instead of her personal computer as Graham had figured.
 
 Graham was soon receiving hospital files, including more than 1,000 screen views, most containing confidential information about medical procedures and diagnostic notes for specific patients. He also received personal e-mail and financial records of four hospital employees.
 
 The surreptitious flow of information went on for nearly three weeks before complaints of slow-acting computers led hospital personnel to discover the spyware, hospital officials said.
 
 The FBI was contacted and Graham ultimately pleaded guilty to a felony, intercepting electronic communications, in U.S. District Court. He faces possible prison time when sentenced early next year, although probation is also possible.
 
 Graham's case raises questions. How could a hospital's security be breached with a legal product? And how many other people might be trying something similar?
 
 Most institutions like hospitals and schools have tools in place to protect their computers from viruses and other malicious software. At the time of the breach, Akron Children's Hospital was doing a systemwide upgrade that included installation of a firewall on all workstations that would have kicked out the spyware, hospital executive Shawn Lyden said.
 
 The firewall was installed but had not yet been activated on the two computers used to open Graham's e-mail attachment, Lyden said.
 
 ""As a result of this, it was activated immediately,"" he said.
 
 Lyden said none of the files received by Graham were used to compromise patient privacy. ""Clearly, Graham had no intention of accessing hospital information,"" he said.
 
 Attorney Ian Friedman said his client sent the e-mail to investigate allegations the woman had made about certain doctors and professionals in their industry. Court documents describe the woman as someone who had a previous relationship with Graham, but they do not offer additional details.
 
 Friedman thinks a lot of people may be operating under the false assumption that using legally purchased spyware in the way Graham did is OK.
 
 ""This case may be a sign of more to come,"" Friedman said, ""but to date this has not been a common prosecution.""
 
 Spyware that runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems has been around for nearly two decades, with 10 to 20 companies still developing it in the United States, said Eric Howes, director of research services at Sunbelt Software, a Florida producer of anti-spyware and anti-virus software protection.
 
 Graham purchased his spyware from SpyTech Software and Design Inc. of Red Wing, Minn.
 
 The company's Web site states its products are legal as long as those buying the software install it on a computer they own.
 
 SpyTech founder Nathan Polencheck said he helped the FBI catch Graham after being contacted last spring. The vast majority of people who buy the company's software use it legally, including parents keeping track of their children's computer habits and employers worried about improper Internet browsing on company time, Polencheck said.
 
 Howes believes that might be an exaggeration, ""but the bottom line is no one really knows,"" he said.
 
 While SpyTech software has legitimate uses, a product that can be installed remotely and without a target's knowledge lends itself to unlawful uses, he said.
 
 But there's plenty of blame to go around, he said. While Akron Children's Hospital had the proper protective software on its computers, it doesn't do any good unless it's turned on.
 
 ""Lesson to be learned there: Don't have gaps in coverage,"" Howes said.
 
 He also faults Graham's victim for opening the attachment.
 
 It's been nearly a decade since the infamous ""I Love You"" computer virus, he said, and ""we still have users blindly clicking attachments that they don't know what it is.""
 
 He said even something sent from a legitimate e-mail address could have been maliciously sent by somebody else.
 
 The e-mail attachment sent by Graham was labeled ""InCaseYouHadDoubts.zip."" It was empty except for the undetectable spyware, Lyden said. It infected a second computer after the woman tried to open the attachment on that machine, too.
 
 Lyden said the hospital has made it ""crystal clear"" since the incident that employees are not to access personal e-mails at work. The hospital spent $33,000 to hire a company to investigate the breach.
 
 Polencheck said that since the Graham case he has enhanced one of his products, Realtime-Spy, so a message box pops up on the target's computer when it's being installed.
 
 ""Now the user has to confirm the installation so you can't do it sneakily anymore,"" he said.
 
 But there are plenty of other spyware products out there for computer users to be concerned about. And for every fix that's created, a pathway around it is designed, which means computer users must be diligent about keeping their virus and spyware protection updated.
 
 ""We are processing several gigabytes of new malicious software every day,"" Howes said. ""That's how fast this stuff is coming out.""",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,21.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 The Pioneer Press reports that while the breach occurred at the Inver Grove Heights clinic, not all affected patients were necessarily treated there. Instead, Allina’s EHR system spans across 11 hospitals and more than 50 physician clinics. The employee, who has since been fired, was able to access patients’ demographic, clinical and insurance information, as well as the last four digits of their Social Security numbers.
 
 “We did not determine a motive,” Allina spokesman David Kanihan said. “We do believe that it is highly unlikely she did this for financial gain or identity theft or anything like that.” Allina also added that it would offer patients free access to identity monitoring services as well as a dedicated call center to answer any patient questions.
 
 This was the 12th patient data breach of 500 patients or more (of 682 total in the U.S.) reported in Minnesota, according to the Pioneer Press, since 2009. “Covered entities were only required to begin reporting breaches of unsecured protected health information to (the government) in 2009,” Rachel Seeger, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Humans Services, wrote in an email.

 The documents were from a recycling bin in the physician’s private office, and were to be shredded at the Minneapolis Heart Institute at Abbott Northwestern Hospital.
 
 On January 20, 2017, Allina Health became aware of the incident and launched an investigation. Allina Health explained that the documents may have contained patient information including names, medical record numbers, addresses, and insurance information.
 
 According to the OCR data breach reporting tool, 776 patients were potentially impacted by the incident.
 
 Because some patients use their Social Security numbers as identification numbers on insurance documents, there is a chance these patients Social Security numbers were exposed, Allina Health stated.

 On January 3, 2017, the hospital became aware of the incident and immediately launched an investigation. Chadron confirmed that between September 2011 and November 2016 the employee had accessed patient EHRs to view demographic information including names, addresses, dates of birth, clinical information, and insurance information.

 The incident impacted 702 patients, according to the OCR data breach reporting tool.
 
 Chadron maintained there is no evidence suggesting the former employee viewed any patient Social Security numbers.
 
 Chadron has issued advisory notices to all potentially impacted patients informing them of the incident.
 
 “Whenever personal information is accessed without authorization, it is advisable that you take measures to help prevent and detect any potential misuse of your information,” Chadron advised in its statement. “We encourage patients who believe they might have been affected to closely monitor financial accounts for unusual activity and consider requesting a free credit report from one of three major credit bureaus.”
 Oregon Medical Center inadvertently exposes patient information
 
 Orange County Global Medical Center recently informed some patients of an incident in which an employee emailed an Orange County Global statistical report to an unintended recipient.

 The organization discovered the incident the same day and contacted the recipient instructing him to immediately and permanently delete the information from his inbox.
 
 The report contained patient treatment and diagnoses information, medical record numbers, dates of birth, treatment dates, and names.
 
 Orange County Global asserted in its notification letter that patient Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, health insurance information, or financial account information were not exposed in the incident.
 
 Orange County Global has not released information regarding how many patients were impacted in the incident.
 
 Besides informing the recipient to delete the information, the healthcare organization has also provided concerned patients with free access to identity monitoring and restoration services for one year.
 
 “We take this matter, and the security and privacy of your information, very seriously,” explained the letter, a copy of which was posted on the California Office of Attorney General. “Since the incident occurred, and in addition to instructing the inadvertent recipient to delete the information, we have implemented additional protocols for sending information, reviewed our policies and procedures, and provided additional training to staff.”
 Sharp Healthcare PHI reportedly stolen
 
 On February 6, 2017, Sharp Healthcare discovered a computer and external storage device were missing from a locked cabinet in a restricted patient care area at the Sharp Memorial Outpatient Pavilion in San Diego.
 
 According to Times of San Diego report, the PHI of over 750 outpatients at the facility may have been accessed as a result of the incident. The devices are believed to have been stolen.
 
 “The devices were used to process and store patient-specific wellness screening information for outpatients undergoing blood pressure and/or cardiac health studies,” Sharp Healthcare said in a statement. “Each study record may have included patient name, date of birth, age, current medications, family history and a summary of the studies performed.”
 
 Sharp mailed letters notifying affected patients of the incident, and added that it is conducting a security practices review.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0.0,776.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2013,AnMed Health (via Health Port),SC,INSD,Other,"Some patients of AnMed Health are worried their information is in the wrong hands.
 
  Hospital officials would not specify how many people received a letter which states someone accessed medical records without a legitimate reason.
 
  AnMed goes on to say the person responsible worked for a third party contractor called Health Port.
 
  The hospital says proper disciplinary action was taken against the employee.
 
  “They got everything,” says Shawn Patterson, who received the letter. “I mean, Social Security numbers, medical history, our religious preference, everything. A person can take that and actually create a profile for themselves.”
 
  When asked about the breach, the hospital would only send a statement which reads, “In this specific instance, our policies and procedures worked as designed and allowed AnMed Health to quickly identify the issue, and provide, what we believe was, an appropriate response to an unauthorized access.”
 
 I could not find any information on AnMed’s site at this point, but I did find media coverage of a lawsuit that appears to have stemmed from this breach:
 
  An Upstate hospital has been sued after allegations that a contract employee illegally accessed and made public patient information.
 
  A lawsuit filed in Anderson County alleges that Angel Roland, a former employee of AnMed Health contractor HealthPort Technologies, illegally accessed patients’ confidential and medical information.

 An individual posing as an employee of Evolve, the company AJH uses for the removal and recycling of imaging study films, stole the X-rays for the silver contained in the film, which can be extracted and sold, according to the hospital's online privacy notification. The imaging studies also contained patients' names, ages, birth dates, medical record numbers and the date the X-ray was taken.
 
 The theft, which was discovered on Aug. 19, involved imaging studies that were taken between April and August. During that time period, AJH conducted 32,605 patient exams.

2018,"Anne Arundel Dermatology, P.A.",MD,Theft,Paper/Films,"August 23, 2018 - A pair of dermatology clinics reported to OCR this month healthcare data breaches that exposed PHI on a total of 5,375 patients.
 
 Maryland-based Anne Arundel Dermatology told OCR on August 9 that 1,310 individuals were affected by the theft of paper records. 
 
 In a statement, the clinic said a burglar broke into a locked cabinet at its Quarterfield medical office and stole cash and check payments from patients, as well as the daily payment logs containing payment information for two of its medical offices.

 The stolen documents may have included patient name, address, billing code, reason for patient visit, method and amount of payments, and bank account information.
 
 Anne Arundel Dermatology advised patients who paid by check at its Quarterfield office between June 1-8 or at its Columbia office between June 7-8 to contact their bank to stop payment. It stressed that no credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, or insurance data was stolen. 
 
 In a separate incident, Colorado-based Central Colorado Dermatology told OCR on August 3 that an IT incident affected 4,065 individuals.
 
 In a statement, the clinic said it discovered on June 5 that attackers had penetrated its network, launched ransomware that encrypted certain files, and could have gained access to certain information on its server.
 
 Information that may have been accessed by the attackers included patients’ full names, dates of birth, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers, insurance carriers, insurance payment codes, payment information, dates of service, medical conditions, diagnoses, medications, labs and diagnostic studies, and copies of notes or reports by the clinic or other healthcare providers.
 
 “We did not find evidence of any patient files being opened on CCD’s computers, but because some of the software installed by the hackers could have been used to download computer files and some files were encrypted, we cannot be sure that health information was not compromised,” the clinic said in its statement.
 
 The clinic said it is providing free online credit monitoring service to victims for one year.
 
 “Because of this incident, we have made changes to how our network may be accessed and modified network password requirements. We have implemented new anti-virus software and are analyzing and considering further upgrades to our system in consultation with seasoned IT professionals. We have verified that incoming faxes are not being saved as digital images on any network computer. We are reinforcing and providing additional security awareness training to our workforce,” the clinic related.
 PHI of 38K Patients Exposed in Legacy Health Phishing Attack

 Information that may have been exposed included patients’ name, dates of birth, health insurance information, billing information, medical information and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers.
 
 The health system said it is providing free credit monitoring to patients who had their Social Security number exposed.
 
 “To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we are implementing additional access restrictions,” it said.

2018,Arkansas Children's Hospital,AR,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"A former employee of Arkansas Children’s Hospital is being investigated by law enforcement over the theft and misuse of patients’ protected health information. According to the breach notice submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights, the former employee potentially viewed and copied the PHI of up to 4,521 patients.
 
 That individual was employed at Arkansas Children’s Hospital for 15 months between November 7, 2016 and February 6, 2018. During that time the employee was provided with access to patient health information to perform essential functions of the job.
 
 On May 9, 2018, law enforcement notified Arkansas Children’s Hospital that an investigation had been launched over the possible theft of patients’ Social Security numbers and personal information and the misuse of that information for personal gain.
 
 Arkansas Children’s Hospital immediately launched an investigation to determine the types of information that were potentially accessed and whether patients’ PHI had been accessed without authorization. While that internal investigation confirmed the types of information that were potentially accessed, it was not possible to determine whether the information was accessed for work purposes or other reasons.
 
 Consequently, the incident has been treated as a data breach and all patients have now been notified of the possible theft and misuse of their PHI. The types of information potentially stolen includes full names, dates of birth, addresses, contact telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, health insurance information, charge amounts, descriptions of services received, and some clinical information.
 
 As a precaution against identity theft and fraud, all 4,521 patients have been offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 12 months. Patients have been advised to monitor their credit reports, financial statements, and Explanation of Benefits statements for any sign of fraudulent activity.

 Through an internal investigation, officials were able to determine an error was made when configuring the server on May 9, 2017, which left documents and copies of identification documents accessible to the internet.
 
 The exposed data included Social Security numbers, insurance cards and drivers licenses, in addition to patient names, addresses, dates of birth, treatment information and the like. This type of data can be used by cybercriminals for identity theft and medical fraud.
 
 The documents stored on the server were from patients who visited BJC between 2003 and 2009. Patients who visited the health system after 2009 weren’t included in the breach. This serves as a reminder for healthcare organizations to be cognizant of what data are stored and connected to the internet.

2014,Bay Park Hospital,OH,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"ProMedica, a nonprofit health care system, is notifying nearly 600 patients of Bay Park Hospital in Ohio that a former employee had been accessing their personal information, without authorization, for about a year.
 
 What happened? A former employee had been accessing the patient information, without authorization, for about a year.
 
 What was the response? The employee’s access to patient information was deactivated and the staffer is no longer employed by ProMedica. Current employees will be receiving training on data privacy. All impacted individuals are being notified, and offered a year of identity theft protection services. 
 
 Details: The former employee accessed the patient information between April 1, 2013, and April 1. The security breach was discovered on April 2. The former employee was not directly treating the impacted patients, and it was not made public exactly why the former employee was accessing the data.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,365.0,600.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2019,Bayamon Medical Center CORPORATION,PR,HACK,Network Server,"More than half a million patients in Bayamón, Puerto Rico have been affected by a ransomware attack on a medical center and its associated hospital.
 
 Bayamón Medical Center and Puerto Rico Women and Children’s Hospital discovered on May 21, 2019 that their computer systems had been infected with ransomware. The ransomware encrypted a wide range of files and prevented hospital staff from accessing patient information ‘for a short period of time,’ according to a July 19, 2019 press release announcing the attack.
 
 Approximately 522,000 current and former patients are being notified about the ransomware attack as a precautionary measure. The internal investigation into the attack confirmed that patient information was affected, but no evidence of unauthorized data access or theft was identified.
 
 The information potentially compromised was limited to names, demographic information, clinical information, financial information, and in some cases, diagnosis information, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.
 
 The ransomware attack only rendered data temporarily inaccessible and all patient information has now been restored without data loss. It is unclear whether the ransom demand was paid for the keys to unlock the encryption or if systems were rebuilt and data restored from backups.
 
 The ransomware attack has been reported to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights as two separate breaches affecting 422,496 patients of Bayamón Medical Center and 99,943 patients of Puerto Rico Women and Children’s Hospital.
 
 The incident is the latest in a string of ransomware attacks on healthcare organizations. Data from Malwarebytes indicates ransomware attacks increased by 195% in Q1, 2019 and a recently published report from Coveware shows ransomware attacks increased by 184% in Q2. Last month, Carbon Black released the findings of a survey which indicated 66% of healthcare organizations had experienced a ransomware attack in the past 12 months.
 
 Until ransomware stops being profitable or a more lucrative method of attacking businesses is found, ransomware attacks will continue. With ransom payments of tens of thousands of dollars being paid to attackers, it is probable that the problem will get much worse before it gets better.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.0,522000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2011,Baylor Heart and Vascular Center,TX,PHYS,Other,"Baylor Heart and Vascular Center in Texas reports that over 8,000 patients might have been affected by the theft of a portable ultrasound diagnostic machine. The device was stolen from a patient’s room in Baylor’s Jack and Jane Hamilton Heart and Vascular Hospital (BHVH) in Dallas on the evening of December 2 or the early morning of December 3, 2010. A statement on Baylor Health Care System’s site linked from their home page says:
 
  We believe the ultrasound machine may have contained limited data on a small number of patients seen at the hospital from December 26, 2006 to December 2, 2010. Patient health information on the machine is limited to patient names, dates of birth, blood pressure, height, weight, and limited health information in the form of ultrasound images of patient’s hearts. Approximately 8,000 patient procedures were performed on the ultrasound machine. However, Baylor believes only a very small fraction of the 8,000 patients’ information was actually contained on the device because the data is regularly purged and overwritten. Therefore, Baylor is not able to determine exactly which patients’ information was on the device. Out of an abundance of caution, Baylor is notifying all patients that could have information contained on the device.
 
 In its notification to the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Service, Baylor reported that 8,241 patients were being notified.
 
 Baylor also indicated that the stolen machine contained patient health information from patients of both BHVH and Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas. No financial information or social security numbers were affected.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,217.0,940.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2018,Baylor Scott & White Medical Center - Frisco,TX,HACK,Network Server,"Baylor Scott & White Medical Center in Frisco, TX, has discovered the payment information of almost 48,000 patients and guarantors may have been compromised.

The medical center, which is jointly managed by United Surgical Partners International (USPI) and Baylor Scott & White Health, discovered an issue with the credit card processing system of one of its vendors. The investigation revealed there had been a week-long computer intrusion between September 22 and September 29. Upon discovery of the issue, the medical center informed the vendor and stopped all credit card processing through the vendor’s system.

Baylor Scott & White Health did not uncover evidence to suggest any patient/guarantor information had been further disclosed or misused; however, as a precaution, all individuals affected by the incident have been offered one year of complimentary credit monitoring services through TransUnion Interactive.

The security breach was limited to the third-party vendor’s system. Hospital information and clinical systems remained secure at all times. No health information or Social Security numbers were exposed. Only the Frisco medical center was affected by the breach.

The information that was exposed and potentially accessed by an unauthorized individual was limited to: Names, addresses, dates of service, medical record numbers, health insurance provider information, account numbers, the last four digits of credit card numbers, CCV numbers, type of credit card used, recurring payment dates, account balances, invoice numbers, and transaction statuses.

All individuals affected by the breach have been notified by mail.

2016,Baystate Health,MA,HACK,Other,"Springfield-MA-based Baystate Health has announced that five employees have fallen victim to a phishing scam that has potentially resulted in the exposure of the protected health information of as many as 13,000 patients.

Scam emails were sent to a number of Baystate Health employees in August this year. The emails were well-written and realistic and appeared to have been sent internally from the human resources office. The emails appeared to have been sent to advise employees of some important changes to salaries and other important HR importation.

However, by following the instructions in the email to view the information, employees inadvertently gave the attackers access to their email accounts and also a Baystate Health database which contained sensitive patient data.

An investigation was launched into the phishing attack which revealed that names, demographic information, patient ID numbers, and dates of birth were all potentially been accessed by the attackers. Certain patients’ treatments and diagnoses were also exposed as a result of the scam. The investigation did not uncover any evidence to suggest that patient data had been viewed or copied, although the possibility could not be ruled out. Baystate Health confirmed that patients’ Social Security numbers, financial information, and medical charts were not compromised in the attack.

Investigators concluded that had the Baystate Health database been opened by the attackers, it was closed rapidly when it was discovered there were no financial data or Social Security numbers present.

Patients have now been informed of the potential PHI breach by mail and have been advised to activate fraud alerts on their accounts and monitor their account statements for any sign of fraudulent activity. No reports have been received that any patients PHI has been abused.

Baystate Health has now secured its email system and is conducting further staff training to raise awareness of the risk of phishing attacks.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,13000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2019,"Baystate Health, INC",MA,HACK,Email,"In February 2019, Baystate Health experienced a phishing attack that resulted in the exposure of the protected health information (PHI) of 12,000 patients. On April 11, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of individuals affected by the breach.

The lawsuit was filed by attorney Kevin Chrisanthopoulos in the U.S. District Court in Springfield, MA, three days after Baystate Health announced the breach.

The lawsuit alleges plaintiffs now face an elevated risk of identity theft and fraud as a result of the phishing attack and seeks monetary damages for all patients whose PHI was exposed.

Upon discovery of the breach, Baystate Health secured its email system and launched an investigation. The investigation revealed the email accounts of nine employees had been compromised as a result of employees responding to phishing emails. The email accounts were subjected to unauthorized access and, as a result, the attacker(s) potentially gained access to patients’ PHI.

For most patients, the information exposed was limited to names, birth dates, diagnoses, treatment information, and medications. Certain patients also had their Medicare number, health insurance information, and/or Social Security number exposed. At the time of issuing notifications – April 8, 2019 – to affected patients, Baystate Health had not been able to confirm whether PHI had been viewed or copied, but no reports had been received to suggest any PHI had been misused.

As a precaution against identity theft and fraud, individuals whose Social Security number was exposed were offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 12 months at no cost.

Baystate Health has taken reasonable steps to improve email security and prevent further data breaches from occurring. Those steps include providing further training for employees, with a specific focus on improving resilience to phishing attacks. Controls have also been implemented to prevent email account access from outside the organization and the frequency of email logging and log reviews has been increased.

Typically, class action lawsuits seeking damages for the exposure of PHI are only successful when it can be established, on the balance of probabilities, that harm has been suffered as a direct result of a data breach. Only in Illinois is it not necessary to establish harm has occurred as a result of the exposure of personal information for lawsuits to have standing.

“This isn’t the first time the medical center allowed confidential information to be accessed,” explained Chrisanthopoulos. “This is unconscionable, and we need to send a message that this cannot happen again.”

Baystate Health had experienced a similar phishing attack in 2016. In that incident, five employee email accounts were breached and the PHI of 13,112 patients was exposed.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,39.0,12000.0,1200000.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

2006,Beaumont Hospital,MI,PORT,Other,"A laptop containing home care information on 28,000 patients has been stolen from the car of a nurse who works for Royal Oak, Mich.-based Beaumont Hospitals, according to a statement from the hospital.

The laptop was in the nurse's car, which was stolen in Detroit on Aug. 5 after the nurse had finished seeing patients. The vehicle was later recovered, but the laptop was missing. The computer contained personal and health information of Home Care patients who had received care over the previous three years, the hospital said.

The Home Care staff uses laptops to document patient care; The data on the stolen laptop -- a Dell Latitude model -- includes patient names, addresses, birth dates, medical insurance information, Social Security numbers and personal health information relating to their home care services. The computer does not include information on services received at the Beaumont Hospitals or other Beaumont outpatient services, the hospital said.

There is no evidence that anyone's personal information has been accessed or misused, the statement said, nor is there any no evidence that the computer was stolen for its data.

While Home Care laptops are encrypted and password protected, the nurse's ID access code and password were with the stolen computer, meaning personal information may be at risk of exposure. The nurse was a new employee still completing orientation.

""We have been working with the Detroit police in investigating the theft and attempting to recover the laptop,"" said Chris Hengstebeck, director of security for Beaumont Hospitals. ""We have communicated the situation to all Home Care patients through a letter and tested and strengthened our computer security systems and processes. We deeply regret that the personal information of our Home Care patients may be at risk for exposure. We are taking aggressive measures to protect their personal and health information and to lessen the impact of the computer theft on them.""

Beaumont said its IT department is reviewing and enhancing computer security systems with its software vendor. The hospital said it has also reinforced laptop security procedures with its Home Care staff.

This is the second breach reported by New York City HHC in which an employee transmitted PHI through email, though the two incidents are unrelated.

According to the patient notification letter, an employee emailed a spreadsheet Jan 15, 2015 to a relative's email account at the relative's place of employment. The employee said she sent the spreadsheet to her relative for technical help in manipulating spreadsheet data for work purposes. The employee also said she did not send the spreadsheet to any other unauthorized recipient, which was confirmed by Bellevue's forensic review.

Compromised information includes names, medical record number, telephone number, email address, name of insurance carrier and ""limited sensitive information,"" according to the notification.

""Regardless of the employee's motivation for sending the email and attachment, the transmission of this information to an unauthorized recipient was certainly improper and is not condoned by Bellevue,"" reads the breach notification.

The Wilmington, DE-based business associate provides a remote monitoring service for BMC patients that have been fitted with cardiac devices. In July, AHS discovered an employee had emailed the protected health information of 41 patients to a personal email account prior to leaving the company.

However, an investigation into the incident revealed that more patient had been affected than was initially thought. The employee had also copied some protected health information onto two thumb drives. Those devices were recovered via law enforcement and were found to contain the sensitive data of thousands of patients.

AHS has now contacted all healthcare providers whose patients have been impacted by the breach and is notifying all affected individuals by mail, although it is the responsibility of each impacted healthcare provider to notify the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights.

While the total number of individuals impacted by the security breach has not been released, the data of 2,500 patients of Greenville Health System in South Carolina, 775 patients of Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover, New Hampshire, and 537 patients of WellSpan Cardiology (formerly Lebanon Cardiology Associates) have also been affected.

BMC patients have been told that their name, address, phone number, date of birth, patient ID number, ethnicity, testing data, Ambucor enrolment number, diagnosis, medications, medical device information, practice where they were being seen, and the names of the Ambucor technician that fitted the device and their physician were also present on one of the thumb drives.

Affected patients will be protected by a $1 million identity theft insurance policy and will be provided with credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for a period of one year without charge; although AHS does not believe any patient data have been used inappropriately.

2011,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,MA,HACK,Network Server,"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center is notifying more than 2,000 patients that some of their personal information may have been stolen from a hospital computer.
The hospital said yesterday that an unnamed computer service vendor had failed to restore proper security settings on a computer after performing maintenance on it. The machine was later found to be infected with a virus, which transmitted data files to an unknown location.
The computer contained medical record numbers, names, genders, and birthdates of 2,021 patients, as well as the names and dates of radiology procedures they had undergone. But the computer did not contain the patients’ financial data or their Social Security numbers, which can be used to steal identities and defraud banks.
“We are grateful no Social Security numbers or financial information were released and apologize for the inconvenience and deeply regret any concern this situation may cause,’’ said John Halamka, the hospital’s chief information officer.
Halamka said the virus transmitted information in an encrypted form, so the hospital does not know exactly what might have leaked, but wanted to inform patients anyway.

2012,Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,MA,Theft,Laptop,"A laptop computer was stolen from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in May 2012. It was not being transported and was not left unattended in a car. The theft occurred inside the hospital with the laptop stolen from a physician’s desk.

Data stored on the laptop included Protected Health Information of close to 4,000 patients and employees, including Social Security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers and other personal identifiable information. In total, 3,796 patients and employees of Beth Israel had confidential data exposed and potentially exposed to criminals.

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has now agreed to settle a complaint and pay $100,000 after the Massachusetts attorney general’s office alleged that the laptop theft could have been prevented had proper security measures been in place.

There were two area of concern: General security at the hospital which facilitated the theft of the device and a failure to use data encryption to protect the PHI of patients. The Attorney General’s office claimed that the data security failures at Beth Israel broke the law and lax standards were responsible for the disclosure of PHI. According to Attorney General, Martha Coakley, “The healthcare industry’s increased reliance on technology makes it more important than ever that providers ensure patients’ personal information and protected health information is secure.”

The data security breach which led to the settlement occurred over two and a half years ago, and during intervening time Beth Israel has implemented changes to policies and procedures to improve data security and ensure that even if a laptop is lost or stolen, the PHI of patients will remain protected. The medical center has also employed state of the art technology to improve data security according to a statement issued by Beth Israel’s Chief Information Officer Dr. John Halama.

“Every device we purchase is encrypted before it is used, and every employee must attest on an annual basis that his or her personal devices are also encrypted.” He said.

The message to other medical centers is clear: It is better – and cheaper – to invest in data security before a breach, rather than invest in it afterwards and also have to pay a large financial penalty for a HIPAA violation.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1.0,3769.0,0.0,1.0,100000.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

The laptop was reported stolen during a burglary at the staffer's Knoxville residence Aug. 25, said Blount Memorial spokeswoman Jennie Bounds.

The password-protected laptop contained registration records from Blount Heart Consultants on approximately 22,000 patients — including their names, dates of birth, responsible party names, addresses, physician names and billing information.

The laptop also held records on approximately 5,000 additional patients, including the above information along with their Social Security numbers and other nonmedical data.

""Payment statuses, credit card numbers and bank account information was not included,"" Bounds specified.

The hospital began notifying patients today, after IT personnel finished verifying whose information was uploaded to the laptop during its most recent backup, Bounds said in explaining the delay.

The hospital also reported the information breach to the Office of Civil Rights, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as required by law.

""And the hospital is continuing to work with authorities,"" Bounds said.

The theft is being investigated by the Knoxville Police Department, she added.

2012,"Blount Memorial Hospital, Inc",TN,Theft,Laptop,"Blount Memorial Hospital has begun notifying 27,000 patients whose personal information was compromised by the theft of an employee's laptop computer in August.

The laptop was reported stolen during a burglary at the staffer's Knoxville residence Aug. 25, said Blount Memorial spokeswoman Jennie Bounds.

The password-protected laptop contained registration records from Blount Heart Consultants on approximately 22,000 patients — including their names, dates of birth, responsible party names, addresses, physician names and billing information.

The laptop also held records on approximately 5,000 additional patients, including the above information along with their Social Security numbers and other nonmedical data.

""Payment statuses, credit card numbers and bank account information was not included,"" Bounds specified.

The hospital began notifying patients today, after IT personnel finished verifying whose information was uploaded to the laptop during its most recent backup, Bounds said in explaining the delay.

The hospital also reported the information breach to the Office of Civil Rights, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as required by law.

""And the hospital is continuing to work with authorities,"" Bounds said.

The theft is being investigated by the Knoxville Police Department, she added.

R-C Healthcare Management, a reimbursement optimization firm, was adjusting its network settings between April 18 and April 21, and in doing so exposed data of Bon Secours patients in three states – 435,000 of them Virginia, and the rest in South Carolina and Kentucky – to be accessible online.

Bon Secours first discovered the vulnerability on June 14 and, in turn, notified R-C Healthcare.

""Upon receiving the notification, R-C Healthcare immediately took steps to secure the information so that it could no longer be accessed via the internet,” according to a statement.

R-C Healthcare CEO K. Michael Webdale told Norfolk, Virginia-based WTKR that the company promptly hired an outside forensic investigator.

""The investigator confirmed the incident has been fully remediated. All R-C customers who might be affected have been notified of the situation and its resolution. ""

Bon Secours also kicked off an internal investigation ands found that the files R-C made available via the internet may have exposed patient names, social security numbers, bank account information and limited clinical data.

“Medical records were not made available via the internet and medical care has not and will not be affected,” the health system said.

Bon Secours officials said it took nearly two months to for an internal investigation to identify the patients who should be notified. The health system began mailing letters to those affected on August 12.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,60.0,650000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Our investigation revealed that a user ID and password assigned to a former employee had been used to access information in the Athena system between April, 2013 and March, 2014. Our investigation determined that the information accessed with the user ID and password for the majority of patients included their name, date of birth and the last four digits of their Social Security number. A small group of patients had additional information accessed which included their name, dates and times of service, provider and facility names, patient account numbers (which may have included Social Security numbers), date of birth, and treatment information, such as diagnosis.
 
 Due to the nature of the access, and out of an abundance of caution to protect our patients, we approached law enforcement, specifically the Secret Service, to assist us with our investigation. The Secret Service asked Bon Secours to delay notifying patients until their investigation was complete so as not to compromise their investigation. The Secret Service worked with Bon Secours to thoroughly investigate this matter and to determine if any patient information may have been used illegally. After discussions with the IRS Identity Task Squad, the Secret Service informed Bon Secours they found no evidence of criminal use of patients’ information at this time. The Secret Service advised on August 26 that we could send letters to affected patients.
 
 As a precaution, we began mailing letters to affected patients on September 5 and are offering all eligible individuals one year free credit monitoring and identity protection services.

""At this time, we have no evidence that any patient information was accessed by anyone other than medical personnel and administrative staff.""

A number of Boston Medical Center physicians had used the transcription services company for several years, the spokeswoman says. Physicians routinely record audio notes about patient visits and then have these audio notes transcribed so they can be added to electronic medical records, she explains.

""Several physicians at BMC utilized MDF to transcribe their notes. Once transcribed, these notes were made accessible to physicians by MDF through an online site administered by subcontractors of MDF,"" she says.

2011,"Boulder Community Health, Boulder Community Hospital",CO,INSD,Other,"A nurse accused of improperly accessing patient records at numerous hospitals in the Denver metro area faces five counts of identity theft and 46 counts of theft of medical records in connection with his time at Boulder Community Hospital between May 2010 and January 2011.
 
 Cannon Lamar Tubb, 31, worked for a now-defunct Denver nurse staffing agency that placed him as an intensive care unit nurse in numerous Centura Health facilities, the Platte Valley Medical Center and Boulder Community Hospital, according to court documents.
 
 Tubb had a nursing license from Texas that was also valid in Colorado, but his license was suspended in January in relation to prescription fraud, according to an arrest affidavit. Centura first discovered Tubb had accessed 85 confidential patient and staff records at its hospitals during a computer audit in 2010 and notified Westminster police, where a detective identified at least three cases of identity theft, according to an arrest affidavit.
 
 Westminster police also identified a possible victim in Boulder and notified Boulder police.
 
 That first victim had filed a complaint after several credit cards were taken out in her name and her husband’s name and used to make purchases, including $758 for an Apple iPad. Detectives traced the IP address used to make the purchase back to Boulder Community Hospital, the affidavit said.
 
 Hospital officials said Tubb worked at BCH for 32 days between May 2010 and January 2011. BCH ran an audit on Tubb’s computer use at the hospital and sent letters to all patients whose records he looked at, as well as all patients who were under his care.
 
 The audit found Tubb viewed demographic information for 74 patients, 46 of whom were never in the intensive care unit, where Tubb worked. He also viewed financial information for some patients. Tubb faces charges of theft of medical records in relation to the non-ICU patients.
 
 Tubb also faces five counts of identity theft for allegedly using information from those records to open credit card accounts and make purchases.
 
 According to the affidavit, Tubb opened or tried to open credit card accounts at Best Buy, Home Depot, Amazon and other stores in the names of people whose records he looked at while at Boulder Community.
 
 Tubb was arrested in Texas earlier this year in relation to the Adams County cases and remains in custody there.
 
 A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Oct. 4 in Adams County.
 
 Charges are expected to be filed against Tubb in Boulder County on Oct. 12.",1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,60.0,85.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

2014,Brigham and Women's Hospital,MA,Theft,Laptop,"November 18, 2014 - Brigham and Woman’s Hospital (BWH) notified patients that an incident in September could potentially have exposed some individuals’ protected health information (PHI).
A BWH physician’s laptop and cell phone were stolen during an armed robbery off hospital grounds on Sept. 24, according to a hospital statement. While the devices were encrypted, the robbers forced the physician to reveal the pass codes and encryption keys to the items.
“Possession of the pass codes/encryption keys along with the devices themselves could provide an individual the ability to view information stored on the laptop or cell phone,” BWH said. “The theft was immediately reported to the Boston Police Department.”
The hospital explained that it does not know if the information on the computer or cell phone has been accessed, but said that as of yet, neither device has been found.
Information about patients receiving treatment at BWH’s Neurology and Neurosurgery programs between Oct. 2011 and Sept. 2014 were on the devices. The information of a small number of individuals who participated in research studies was also included in the missing data, BWH said. In total, 999 patients PHI was potentially put at risk from the breach.
Patient names, medical record number, age, medications, and information about diagnosis and treatment were all included on the stolen devices. However, BWH said that the PHI did not include Social Security numbers or other financial information.
“Upon learning of this theft, BWH initiated a thorough investigation, including the creation of a multidisciplinary workgroup to respond to this incident,” the statement said. “BWH is currently reviewing related policies and procedures in an effort to determine if there are steps that BWH can take that may decrease the likelihood of reoccurrence of this type of incident in the future.”
The hospital started sending letters to potentially affected patients on Nov. 17, but stated that it does not think the information will be misused. BWH is also urging individuals who believe they might be affected to reach out to the BWH toll free Helpline.
According to a MyFoxBoston report, the incident is connected to several other armed robberies that took place the same night in the Jamaica Pond neighborhood. Boston police told the news source that the physician was attacked by two individuals. The robbers took the devices after they tied the physician to a tree while one man held a gun and the other had a knife
However, police did make two arrests after a similar robbery took place in Franklin Park. The individuals were believed to be responsible for the other armed robberies, according to police.
Lost or stolen devices are a leading cause of health data breaches. Last month, the California Attorney General released a report showing that 70 percent of the health data breaches reported in the past two years were because of stolen or lost hardware or digital media that held unencrypted personal information.
While the BWH incident had encrypted devices, it is still an example of why healthcare organizations need to have numerous physical safeguards in place to ensure that patient data remains secure.

Phishing Attack Suffered by Brigham and Women’s and Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospitals
 

Late last year, a Brigham and Women’s Hospital employee fell victim to a phishing attack that resulted in the login credentials of an email account being divulged to the attacker. The email account contained a limited amount of PHI of a small percentage of patients of both the Brigham and Women’s and Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospitals in Boston.

According to a breach notice posted on the Brigham and Women’s Hospital website, only one email account was compromised and the electronic health record system was unaffected. Financial account information, Social Security numbers and health insurance numbers were not compromised in the attack, although affected patients have potentially had the following information disclosed: Name, medical record number, date of birth, date of service, provider name, health diagnoses and treatment information.

While access to the email account was provided to the attacker, the hospital has not received any reports that patient data have been used inappropriately. Breach notification letters were mailed to all affected patients on January 11, 2016., to alert them to the privacy breach.

On October 18, 2018, Elizabethtown Community Hospital discovered an unauthorized individual had gained access to an employee’s email account. The password for the compromised email account was immediately changed and a leading forensic security firm was retained to conduct an investigation into the breach. The investigation, which lasted 60 days, confirmed that a single email account was compromised on October 9, 2018.

The hospital’s information technology systems were not accessed and medical records remained secure at all times. An analysis of the breached email account revealed it contained the PHI of around 32,000 patients. The types of information that were exposed differed from patient to patient and may have included names, addresses, dates of birth, primary information such as medical record numbers, dates of service, summaries of services provided, and limited medical information. The Social Security numbers of 1,200 patients were also exposed.

During the nine days that the account was accessible it is possible that the PHI of patients was viewed or copied, although no evidence of data theft was found. Elizabethtown Community Hospital is unaware of any misuse of patient information.

Elizabethtown Community Hospital decided to notify 32,000 patients out of an abundance of caution. The investigation is ongoing, and the breach may be found to have affected fewer patients.

The hard drive was lost on June 21, when the doctor, who worked for both hospitals, left the hard drive in a piece of luggage in a cab.

The doctor then notified the hospital. In the ensuing internal investigation, the doctor said patient information had been downloaded to the drive but had been deleted. The hospital notified patients because it couldn’t be sure the information had been destroyed.

No Social Security numbers, insurance account numbers or credit card numbers were ever stored on the drive, but the drive did contain patients’ names, medical record numbers, dates of admission, medications, diagnoses and treatments before that information was deleted.

2017,Bronson Healthcare Group,MI,HACK,Email,"Bronson Healthcare Group says its email system was the target of an internet attack that potentially exposed information on several thousand patients.

The breach of email accounts of five employees potentially exposed information on 8,256 patients, but the medical records of those patients and others were never at risk, Bronson officials said.

An online scammer used ""phishing"" to access the accounts of the five workers between June 12-27. The hospital system discovered and diagnosed the situation in early November. It issued a letter to the affected patients Dec. 5, apologizing for the breach and explaining what happened.

""Bronson immediately took action to secure the impacted email accounts and engaged external cyber security professionals to analyze what information might have been compromised,"" Charlia Aardema, senior privacy analyst for Bronson, stated in the Dec. 5 letter to patients.

The letter indicates that patient health information was contained in one of the breached employee email accounts. It included patient names, medications and treatments. But the hospital said Thursday, Jan. 4, that there have been no reports of fraud or identity theft as a result.

Information on 8,256 Bronson Healthcare Group patients in Kalamazoo, Calhoun and Van Buren counties was potentially exposed to the breach because ""in an employee email, there was 8,256 pieces of protected health information on patients,"" Chris Sangalli, vice president and chief compliance officer for Bronson Healthcare Group, said. ""That 8,256 represents patients impacted.""

But she said, ""I think it's important to mention that the medical record of patients is a part of a very separate system and was never at risk in this.""

Phishing is an electronic scam in which crooks send emails that appear to be from a trustworthy company or reputable source to trick people into revealing personal information such as their credit card numbers, usernames or account passwords.

Sangalli said the attack at Bronson was apparently focused on obtaining employee credentials and passwords in order to gain access to payroll.

""We installed some new employee software in June and we know that the target was employee payroll information,"" she said. ""The target was not to receive patient information.""

The pay of at least one of the employees was diverted to an unauthorized place, she said. But Bronson has made sure that employee and the others were made whole, Sangalli said.

""In some employee emails there was patient information, and we were never able to determine whether the information was used or anything was opened or downloaded in any way,"" she said.

The attack was reported to the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety but there has been no word on the hacker, or whether he was a local person or someone from far outside the area.

Michael Kitchen, 67, of Portage, said he wonders why the health system did not contact patients about the matter until early December. Kitchen is a current patient at Bronson Methodist Hospital but is not among those potentially affected by the breach. He said he received a copy of the letter about the breach from a friend who is a patient and is affected.

For 30 years, Kitchen owned and operated Front Row, a Portage-based computer systems integration company that created and maintained computer systems for small and medium-size businesses and worked with some area school districts and police departments.

""People are responsible for keeping the data in their databases secure, especially when it comes to their clients, customers and employees,"" said Kitchen.

""If somebody wants to keep that protected they would keep it on their internal network only,"" he said.

Kitchen said a problem for many companies is that their internal networks are not properly segmented, and lack firewalls, software updates and other precautions to safeguard computers that are connected to systems that are accessible by outsiders. He said sensitive data should be stored in a computer or database that is not connected to the outside world via a telephone wire, a cable line from an internet service provider, or a WIFI hotspot.

Bronson's breach, however, did not involve someone hacking into its computer systems but rather employees being tricked into giving access to email accounts.

""In a phishing attack, you give the person who is phishing you your credentials,"" she said. ""So you're giving them your password.""

Although she said the hospital has ongoing training to help its workers identify computer hacks and phishing, the breach occurred.

Hospital spokeswoman Carolyn Wyllie said the breach was discovered by Bronson's information technology staff, who routinely monitor the hospital's technology and computer systems. She said Bronson hired an independent forensic investigator to determine whether the exposed patient emails have been accessed. The investigator, whose report was submitted in November, was not able to tell whether any had, she said.

Wyllie and Sangalli said the notification letter to patients was not sent until Dec. 5 because it took some time to determine the correct response to the situation, to accurately determine which patients were exposed, find their correct contact information, and to have a mail service handle the mailing.

Bronson also ran a public notice advertisement of the situation that same day in the Kalamazoo Gazette, the Battle Creek Enquirer and The Courier Leader of Paw Paw.

The matter is being investigated by the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The breach is one of about 395 current incidents that office is investigating nationwide.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,125.0,8256.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2013,Broward Health Medical Center,FL,Unauthorized Disclosure,Desktop Computer,"1.
Broward Health recently notified 960 patients via letter that a former Broward Health Medical Center employee stole their personal data between October and December 2012.

Broward apparently learned in June that the employees stole “face sheets” that held basic information such as a patient’s name, address, date of birth, insurance policy numbers and reason for visit, according to the Sun Sentinel.

Broward Health said in the patient notice on its site that the face sheets currently display only the last four digits of the patient’s Social Security number and do not contain test results. It also said that it has no indication that medical records were compromised or are at risk. In response to the incident, Broward is “strengthening procedures surrounding the protection of personal information and re-educating staff members. The hospital system has completed an internal investigation and is reviewing and enhancing safeguards to better ensure the security of patient information.”

Patient notice originally reported by PHIPrivacy.net.

Hospice of the Chesapeake announces data breach

Instead of being the external infiltration that officials were expecting, a two-month Hospice of the Chesapeake internal investigation found that an employee’s email account was used to gain access to patient data.

The Maryland Gazette reported that the employee had emailed spreadsheets containing 500 patients’ information such as names, ages, dates of service, diagnoses and medical record numbers to a personal account on August 8 to complete work from home.

President Michael McHale explained why the organization reported the breach on October 9, two months after the breach occurred. “We didn’t go public right away because we didn’t want to jump to conclusions,” McHale said. “When we had a better grasp of the situation, we moved forward with informing everyone.” The Gazette also reports that Hospice of the Chesapeake “re-evaluated its privacy regulations and security programs and sent all 175 employees through emergency training on federal and state patient privacy regulations and practices.”

For the second time in three years, a data breach at Broward Health has caused the release of personal patient information in what one district executive called “a ring of thugs.”

Broward Health disclosed the breach on its website last month, saying it was advised by “law enforcement authorities” on May 12 that “patient information was discovered at an individual’s home during a routine investigation.”

Broward Health’s internal investigation later determined the sensitive patient information “was taken from Broward Health Imperial Point” in Fort Lauderdale by “an unidentified individual.”

The stolen information were hospital Facesheets that contain a patient’s full name, date of birth, address, phone numbers, Social Security number, primary insurance provider, insurance guarantor, reason for visit, emergency contact/next of kin information.

“The data removal is believed to have occurred between November 2011 and March 2012. We have notified 126 former patients or their listed next of kin of the privacy breach by mailing a letter to their last known address on September 23, 2016,” Broward Health’s disclosure said. “We also offered them an identity theft protection service at no cost.”

No explanation was given for the gap in time between the breach and the date it was discovered. Broward Health, however, said it has completed its internal probe and is “reviewing and enhancing safeguards to better ensure the security of patient information.”

Doris Peek, Broward Health’s senior vice president and chief information officer, said the breach is the latest in a series of data thefts at Florida hospitals, including Fort Lauderdale’s Holy Cross, Hollywood’s Memorial Regional and the University of Florida’s Shands Hospital in Gainesville.

‘Busted last year’
“This ring of thugs got busted last year,” said Peek. “They send in tax information to the IRS about persons to get their tax refund. They targeted the older and sick population.

Peek said the identity theft ring has paid hospital registrars, among the lowest paid of hospital workers, to provide them with printed copies of the Facesheets.

Police in Coral Springs, responding to a domestic violence report, found the Broward Health Facesheets, and turned them over to Broward Health’s security department, said Peek.

Broward Health disclosed a larger data breach in 2013 at Broward Health Medical Center, the hospital district’s flagship in downtown Fort Lauderdale. That time Broward Health sent letters to approximately 960 former patients notifying them of the breach involving their personal information.

Again the breach involved misappropriated Facesheets. However, Broward Health managed to identify the culprit as “an employee who no longer works at the hospital.” The ex-employee was not named. The breach was said to have occurred between October and December 2012.

In September 2013, Holy Cross notified 9,900 former patients that a former employee had wrongly accessed their personal information. CBS Miami reported then that an investigation by the hospital found “the employee may have wanted the information to file fraudulent tax returns.”
Holy Cross suffered another breach in 2010 when an identity theft ring obtained emergency room files to steal Social Security numbers and other information of about 1,500 patients, according to a report in the Sun-Sentinel. Four people were arrested, including an emergency room employee.

In 2012, Memorial Healthcare System notified about 9,500 patients of an investigation into two ex-employees who improperly accessed patient records. The former employees were apparently using the private information in those records to file false tax returns, according to a story at the time by Modern Healthcare.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0.0,960.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2015,California Pacific Medical Center,CA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"Sutter Health, a not-for-profit health system in Northern California, has issued a breach notification alerting the public and patients to a security incident that occurred at its California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC).
CPMC reported that it discovered a case of improper access of patient records by an employee during one of its “proactive” audits of electronic medical records on October 10, 2014. That audit showed that one employee had accessed the records of 14 patients. Those patients were mailed breach notification letters on October 21st 2014 and the work contract of the employee in question was terminated.
Once the breach had been stopped, CPMC investigated the matter further and discovered a total of 844 patient records had potentially been viewed inappropriately, as there appeared to be no apparent treatment or business purpose that required those records to be viewed. The records were accessed over a period of a year, between October 2013 and October 2014
According to the statement, the information which was potentially accessed by the employee included “patient demographics, last four digits of social security number, clinical information including diagnosis and clinical notes, and prescription information.”
The notification pointed out that the employee did not see “full Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, California identification numbers, credit card numbers or financial account information.”
CPMC has assessed the risk and deems it to be minimal and in the breach notifications already issued and it says that no action is required by patients who have been affected by the breach.
The healthcare provider has determined that the employee only accessed the patient records out of curiosity and without any malicious intent. Since the employee no longer works for the hospital, there is no further risk to patients. Because of this, patients have not been offered any identity theft protection or credit monitoring services.
CPMC confirmed that it takes the privacy of patients seriously and as a result of this incident has reiterated the importance of data privacy with the staff and that inappropriate and unauthorized access of patient health records will result in loss of employment.
Further steps CPMC could take to improve data privacy and security is to increase the frequency of their internal audits or at least to introduce more frequent checks of access logs. HIPAA rules required covered entities to routinely monitor for inappropriate access to patient health records. Had this been the case, CPMC may have been able to identify the breach much more quickly and reduce the number of patients affected.

2.
The following press release from California Pacific Medical Center, a Sutter Health facility, was submitted to the California Attorney General’s web site today. A copy of the notice, dated January 23, 2015, is also posted on CPMC’s web site:

Audit finds employee access to patient files without apparent business or treatment purpose

California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) recently notified 844 patients of its discovery that a pharmacist employee may have accessed their records without a business or treatment purpose.

CPMC first learned of the incident through a proactive audit of its electronic medical record system on October 10, 2014. The initial audit resulted in identification and notification of 14 individuals on October 21, 2014. Following its policy, CPMC terminated its relationship with the employee and broadened the investigation

The expanded investigation identified a total of 844 patients whose records the employee may have accessed without an apparent business or treatment purpose. It is unclear whether all of these records were accessed inappropriately but, out of an abundance of caution, CPMC notified all of these patients.

CPMC has determined that between October 2013 and October 2014, the employee accessed the following types of information without an apparent valid purpose: patient demographics, last four digits of social security number, clinical information including diagnosis and clinical notes, and prescription information. The type of information varied for each patient. While the employee potentially viewed the last four digits of some social security numbers, the employee did not have access to full Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, California identification numbers, credit card numbers or financial account information. CPMC has no evidence of a malicious intent or any unauthorized sharing of patient information by the employee. CPMC believes that the employee accessed the information out of curiosity.

No action is required by the patients in response to CMPC’s notice.

CPMC takes patient privacy very seriously. CPMC has also reiterated to all staff that policy allows them to access patient information only when necessary to perform job duties and that violating this policy may result in loss of employment.

Law enforcement agencies have notified Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) that the protected health information of some of its subscibers has been obtained by an unauthorized individual.

Everett Massachusetts Police Department alerted, on January 31, 2018, CHA that data the incorporated the PHI of some of its patients had been identified in the possession of an hacker unauthorized to have the data in question. After being told of the breach, CHA carried out an internal investigation into the breach and reviewed the files.

One of the files, at least, contained data that referred to financial details which included patients’ names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, employer information, costs of healthcare services, and discharge details. The information in question referred to the 2013 billing period.

A breach notice sent to affected individuals by the law firm BakerHostetler on behalf of CHA stated that HIPAA breach targeted four people from New Hampshire, who have been offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Experian free of charge.

While the breach notice submitted reveals that just four individuals were targeted, the Boston Globe has published that notification letters have been sent to an estimated 2,500 patients. The information regarding the breach are the same aside from the number of individuals targeted.

Boston Globe also revealed that CHA spokesman David Cecere confirmed that the investigation is ongoing it is still unclear how the information came to be obtained. Cecere revealed that it could have been a hack or the information could have been made public in error

In addition to the internal investigation completed, CHA has hired a computer forensics consultancy firm to aid the attempts to determine exactly how the data was made public.

2.
Cambridge Health Alliance on Friday said that it has notified patients of a data breach that resulted in billing information for 2,500 people landing in the hands of an “unauthorized third party.”

Officials with the healthcare provider, which operates numerous hospitals and primary care centers north of Boston, do not know whether the breach was the result of an intentional hack, or whether the data was inadvertently made public, CHA spokesman David Cecere said in an e-mail Friday night.

Some of the data contained healthcare billing information from 2013, which could include patients’ names, addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, social security numbers, charges for health care services, and discharge dates, CHA said in a statement Friday.

CTCA knew about the phishing attack on July 29, 2019 when there was suspicious activity identified in the email account of a CTCA staff member. The breach investigation findings revealed that the attacker had 7-day access to the account beginning July 22.

Upon learning about the breach, CTCA promptly secured the email account and blocked the unauthorized individual from further accessing the account. No evidence was found whether patient data contained in the email messages and attachments were accessd or copied by the attacker. Nevertheless, such a possibility can’t be ruled out.

The attacker possibly accessed these types of data: names, phone numbers, addresses, birth dates, medical record numbers, medical records, medical insurance details, and other patient identifiers. Social Security numbers were not exposed, hence, CTCA no credit monitoring and identity theft protection services were offered to affected patients. Still, it is advisable for the affected patients to check their explanation of benefits statements for fraudulent transactions and report it, if there’s any.

The breach report submitted to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights by CTCA indicated that the incident impacted about 3,290 patients.

Since November 2018, CTCA already had five breaches reported to OCR . The first breach report submitted on November 6, 2018 involved the 41,948 patients of Western Regional Medical Center in Arizona. The second breach report was submitted on July 12. The phishing attacks affected 3,904 patients of Eastern Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania and 3,904 patients of Southeastern Regional Medical Center. Another breach report on May 10, 2019 involved a phishing attack that affected 16,819 patients of Southeastern Regional Medical Center.

Employee-Related Data Breach in Humana

A Humana former employee was terminated from work last December 2018 for sending to a personal email account the details of a customer list. The list includes the information of 500 clients from Lafayette, LA such as member names, telephone numbers, email addresses, address, birth dates, Humana ID numbers, and plan numbers.

The wife of the ex-employee who was investigated confirmed that the list was used to get information on potential clients for an insurance brokerage company. Humana customers received phone calls from April to May 2019. The wife claimed that they did not share the list with any other.

The persons affected by this breach received notification letters and were directed to contact Humana in case of fraudulent use of their information.

The Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA) has had its name cross my desk a lot this past year. And that’s not a good thing. There have been five Cancer Treatment Centers of America breach notices that have been publicly disclosed since November 2018. Three of them involved the Southeastern Regional Medical Center in Atlanta, Georgia.

In November 2018, CTCA at Western Regional Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona notified HHS that 41,948 patients were potentially affected by a phishing incident that occurred in May 2018.

In May 2019, CTCA at Southeastern Regional Medical Center in Georgia notified HHS that 16,819 patients were being notified of a phishing incident that occurred in March 2019.

Two months later, CTCA at Eastern Regional Medical Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania notified HHS that 3,904 patients were being notified of a phishing incident that occurred in May. And on the same day, Southeastern Regional Medical Center in Atlanta also notified HHS of yet another phishing incident that they had experienced. This one reportedly impacted 4,559 patients.

On September 27, two months after their second report, CTCA at Southeastern Regional Medical Center notified HHS of yet a third incident involving phishing. This one potentially impacted 4,559 patients.

CTCA’s home page for Atlanta’s hospital shows links to two breach notices. Can the third be far behind?
Not seeing the third breach listed on their web site, DataBreaches.net reached out to CTCA at Southeastern Regional Medical Center to confirm that the third incident really was a new incident and not just a revision of one of their earlier reports. This site also asked the somewhat obvious question as to what CTCA was going to do to prevent these recurring breaches involving phishing.

Abigail Obre, National Manager, External Affairs & Communications for CTCA sent the following statement to DataBreaches.net:

Two employees at CTCA Atlanta recently fell victim to sophisticated phishing attacks that may have involved certain personal information about some of our patients. Upon learning of this suspicious activity, we immediately took measures to curtail the suspected access, promptly opened investigations and retained a nationally recognized forensics firm to assist us. No patient Social Security numbers or financial information were involved. We take our responsibility to safeguard personal information seriously and remain committed to protecting patient privacy and security. We have implemented enhanced controls and heightened our security training programing (sic) to help ensure this does not happen in the future.
I would be surprised if any of my readers actually believed that providing more security training to help prevent phishing attacks is likely to ensure that they do not happen again. So what kinds of enhanced controls is CTCA implementing? They wouldn’t say, stating that

We do not believe providing information about specific enhancements or controls we’ve implemented would be in the best interests of patient privacy.
Well, I can certainly understand not wanting to publicly identify all your security measures, but after three breaches in six months, I think more information might be in order if you want to reassure patients that you’ve got things under control.

And will HHS OCR have anything to say about three incidents in six months? It would seem that they might, but maybe they have different priorities.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,120.0,41948.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2010,Carolina Center for Development and Rehabilitation,NC,PHYS,Other,"A Charlotte doctor was forced to pay a hefty fine for dumping his patients' financial and medical information in the summer of 2010.

WBTV first covered the story about Dr. Ervin Batchelor of the Carolina Center for Development and Rehabilitation in mid-June 2010. Now, Dr. Batchelor has paid $40,000 as a fine, according to a statement released by the NC Attorney General's Office.

Earlier WBTV story: Medical records found at recycling center

Batchelor owns and operates Carolina Center, a psychological testing and treatment facility located at 6813 Fairview Road Suite D in Charlotte. 

His office illegally disposed of 1,000 patient files by dumping them at the West Mecklenburg Recycling Center in June of 2010.

Officials said the files contained info for 1,600 people with data such as: names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, drivers' license numbers, insurance account numbers, and health information.

Sherri Dobbins of Charlotte had a file that was one of hundreds of patients whose personal information was discarded in the trash bin.

""What if the wrong people got hold of it, and two or three months from now my identity -- I find out somebody's taken my identity?"" Dobbins told WBTV when the files were first found.  ""All the information they needed was right there in that file.""

The records were accidentally discarded in a public recycling bin and thrown out by the doctor's sons during a move from one office to another, Batchelor's attorney told WBTV last year. 

The sons mistakenly took the 25 boxes of medical files containing social security numbers, medical histories and pictures of patients to the West Mecklenburg Recycling Center on Byrum Road somewhere between June 22-24, the attorney told WBTV.

Many of the records were from 2007-2009.  By law, medical providers are required to keep patient records for at least six years before discarding them.  State law also requires when records are to be discarded, they should be burned, pulverized or shredded to protect patient privacy.

""Any business you entrust with your information has a duty to keep it safe,"" Attorney General Roy Cooper said. ""Sensitive financial and health information should never be carelessly dumped, putting customers and patients at risk of identity theft.""

The Attorney General's office says medical records also face additional restrictions under federal health privacy laws.

However, out of an abundance of caution, we began mailing letters to affected patients on October 12, 2018, and have established a dedicated call center to answer any questions patients may have. If you believe you are affected and have not received a letter by November 15, 2018, please call 1-877-214-4239, from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday.

We recommend that affected patients review the statements they received from their health insurer. If they see services they did not receive, contact the insurer immediately.

We deeply regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause our patients. To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we have hired security experts to enhance our employee education; we have implemented tighter e-mail controls; and we continue to upgrade our hardware and software platforms to combat these malicious threats.

North Carolina-based Catawba Valley Medical Center is notifying 20,000 patients that their personal data was breached after three successful phishing attacks.

THE IMPACT

Officials discovered unauthorized access on an employee email account on Aug. 13 and immediately secured the account and launched an investigation with help from a third-party forensic firm. The investigation determined it was not one but two accounts hacked for more than a month between July 4 and August 17.

The investigation found those email accounts included patient names, dates of birth, medical data and health insurance information, according to officials. Social Security numbers were included for some patients.

Catawba Valley began notifying patients on Oct. 12 and created a dedicated call center to handle patient questions about the breach. Officials are recommending patients review any statements they receive from their insurance carrier to make sure they’re not billed for any services they didn’t receive.

The medical center has since hired security experts to improve employee education while bolstering email controls and upgrading its software and hardware controls, officials said.

THE TREND

Catawba Valley joins the unfortunate trend of breaches caused by undetected phishing attacks. Two breaches in October went on for weeks to months. Gold Coast Health Plan notified 37,000 patients that their data was hacked for more than a month after a phishing attack.

Meanwhile, the Minnesota Department of Human Services was blasted by state officials after phishing attacks on two separate employee email accounts went undetected for more than a month, breaching 21,000 patient records.

And over the summer, four other organizations reported similar breaches: UnityPoint, Sunspire, Manitowoc County and Legacy Health.

While organizations may be flooded with an abundance of data or perhaps lack sufficient staff for detecting abnormalities, network monitoring and access management are no longer optional given the steady onslaught of malicious attacks. Some of these tasks can be automated, which can improve detection.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,43.0,20000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2014,Cedars-Sinai Health System,CA,Theft,Laptop,"Although there is no indication of any actual or attempted unauthorized access to health information, Cedars-Sinai Health System will be notifying certain patients who have the potential to be affected by the theft of a Cedars-Sinai-issued laptop computer that may have contained some of their health information. There is no indication that the laptop contained complete medical or billing records of any patient. Remote access from this laptop to the Cedars-Sinai computer network has been terminated.

While the laptop was password-protected, it did not contain additional encryption software, a violation of Cedars-Sinai policy. As a result, some information was potentially stored in temporary files on the laptop’s hard drive at the time of the theft.

“Cedars-Sinai takes the security of our patients’ health information very seriously, and has multiple security safeguards in place to protect health information,” said David Blake, Cedars-Sinai’s chief privacy officer. “Even a potential data security incident on a single computer, as has occurred here, is not acceptable to us. We apologize to the people affected by this incident, and have taken actions to prevent any re-occurrence.” The laptop, which was used by the employee for troubleshooting software used for clinical laboratory reporting, was stolen along with personal items of the employee in a June 23 burglary at the employee’s home. (The employee’s duties included being available outside of normal business hours to troubleshoot software problems as they occurred, which is why the laptop was at the home.) The employee immediately notified Cedars-Sinai and the local police of the theft. The local police investigation is ongoing, no arrests have been made, and the laptop has not been recovered.

Cedars-Sinai initiated a comprehensive investigation immediately after the laptop was reported stolen on June 23. Cedars-Sinai retained independent experts in computer forensics to manually and electronically review the files that may have been on the laptop at the time of the theft and to identify any Cedars-Sinai patients whose information may have been stored on the stolen device. This investigation is ongoing.

Cedars-Sinai is mailing letters next week to those identified as being potentially affected by the incident. Should the ongoing file review identify any additional individuals affected, Cedars-Sinai will notify them as well.

The specific information potentially available on the laptop varied depending on the individual, but consisted in general of some combination of medical record number, patient identification number, lab testing information, treatment information and diagnostic information. A small percentage of the files also contained the patient’s Social Security number or other personal information.

In an abundance of caution, Cedars-Sinai’s letter recommends that the potentially affected patients regularly review any Explanation of Benefits statement received from health insurance companies, and contact the health insurance company if there are services listed that the individual has not received. Cedars-Sinai is also recommending that all concerned individuals review account statements and monitor credit reports for suspicious activity.

Cedars-Sinai has updated its breach disclosure to indicate that 33, 136 patients had protected health information on a laptop stolen from an employee’s home this summer.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0.0,33136.0,3313600.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2008,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,CA,INSD,Other,"More than 1,000 patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center had their personal information taken by a former employee in the hospital’s billing department, according to hospital officials who said prosecutors allege that the man used the identities to steal from insurance companies.

The hospital’s chief financial officer warned affected patients in a letter sent last week that their information had been found during a search of the former employee’s home. He urged them to monitor their credit reports and to notify the district attorney’s office if they noticed anything unusual.

The allegations against James Allen Wilson, 44, of Los Angeles mark the latest in a series of privacy breaches at area hospitals, where staffers have been caught peeking at the files of celebrities as well as their co-workers and friends.

In this case, hospital officials said Allen -- who last worked at Cedars-Sinai in March 2007 -- had legitimate access to the patients’ records for billing purposes, but did not have permission to take identifying information home.

ADVERTISEMENT
So far, investigators have alleged that the scheme netted Wilson at least $69,000, said Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office. But she said the investigation is continuing, and the scope and scale of the alleged theft could grow.

Wilson was arrested Nov. 6 by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. He has pleaded not guilty to multiple felony charges, including identity theft, insurance fraud and grand theft. He remains in custody on $895,000 bail and is scheduled to be in court Jan. 22. Attempts to reach his attorney Monday were not successful.

Hospitals’ increasing reliance on computerized record-keeping has provided new avenues for identity theft and invasions of medical privacy. As recently as May, a Glendale man was convicted of using the names of hundreds of Los Angeles County and city employees to submit fraudulent claims for diagnostic services amounting to more than a quarter-million dollars.

Cedars-Sinai officials said they are serious about their responsibility to protect patients’ information.

“In this case, it appears the privacy breach was not the result of someone accessing information they should not have accessed, but instead the privacy breach involved an individual illegally using information that he had legitimate access to as part of his job,” Chief Financial Officer Edward Prunchunas wrote in the letter that the hospital provided to The Times.

Prunchunas assured the recipients that there was no immediate indication that their personal information had been used for anything other than fraudulent insurance claims.

He said hospital officials had no knowledge of any illegal activity until alerted recently by prosecutors.

“We are deeply concerned and troubled about any privacy breach, and expect that you will feel similarly,” Prunchunas said. “I would like to personally apologize for the fact that a former employee was apparently involved in this criminal activity.”

Wilson worked in Cedars-Sinai’s workers’ compensation accounts department from January 2003 and until March 2007, when he left the hospital for reasons unrelated to the case, Cedars-Sinai spokeswoman Elise Anderson said. She declined to elaborate, citing the hospital’s obligation to protect employees’ privacy.

Because of the ongoing investigation, district attorney’s officials refused to discuss details of the case against Wilson, including the affected insurance companies.

According to the hospital’s letter, prosecutors told the hospital that Wilson set up a fake laboratory company. He allegedly used the names of actual workers’ compensation beneficiaries to submit claims for services that were never performed at the fictitious lab, the letter said. The insurers sent payments by check to a post office box that Wilson set up, the letter said.

When investigators searched Wilson’s home at the time of his arrest, they found the records of legitimate workers’ compensation claims belonging to 1,005 patients, Anderson said. By Monday, few of those patients had responded to the hospital’s letter. Those who contacted the hospital reported that they had suffered no personal financial losses, Anderson said.

When a patient’s medical records are compromised, it can hurt more than their wallets, experts warn. Victims of this kind of fraud face a greater risk of injury if doctors make treatment decisions based on incorrect information contained in their records. Many employers also demand access to medical records when making hiring, promotion or benefits decisions, according to the nonprofit Patient Privacy Rights Foundation.

The wife of one man who received the letter said they felt doubly victimized, first by the injury on the job and now by the theft of his personal details. She and her husband asked not to be identified because they have both suffered work-related injuries and she is still in the process of seeking compensation for care.

“I never expected it,” he said. “This is one of the best hospitals I have been treated at -- the doctors, the nurses, everybody -- and it’s very sad that an employee would do something like this.”

Cedars-Sinai has faced previous problems with breaches of patient confidentiality.

Hospital spokesman Richard Elbaum told The Times earlier this year that three or four workers are terminated annually for trying to peak at celebrity patients’ records. There are also suspicions that someone at the hospital tipped the celebrity news website TMZ.com to a story on a medication error last year that nearly killed the infant twins of actor Dennis Quaid and his wife, Kimberly, although no one has been charged.

Similar problems have surfaced at one of the hospital’s major competitors, UCLA Medical Center, where at least 165 staff members have been disciplined for improperly accessing the files of more than 1,000 patients, including California First Lady Maria Shriver, actress Farrah Fawcett and singer Britney Spears.

The allegations in the Wilson case, however, mark a different challenge because he was permitted access to the files as part of his job, Anderson said.

Cedars-Sinai officials said that although they continually reevaluate security procedures, they plan to use the latest breach as another opportunity to review the way the hospital monitors the conduct of employees who have access to patients’ information.

The hospital already uses passwords, security cameras and audits to monitor who has accessed the files, among other methods.

Even more security is in place in the case of high-profile patients, including limits on the employees who can view their records and real-time alerts to signal inappropriate access. If someone gets past those hurdles they will see an on-screen warning: “This patient record is restricted. All accesses are logged and audited. Inappropriate accesses are grounds for disciplinary action and/or dismissal.”",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,1005.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2013,Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,CA,INSD,Other,"Anna Gorman and Abby Sewell  report that five employees and a student research assistant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center have been fired for inappropriately accessing 14 medical records in a one-week period last month.

Four were employees of community physicians who have medical staff privileges at the hospital, one was a medical assistant employed by Cedars-Sinai, and one was an unpaid student research assistant.
Five of the workers accessed a single patient record; the other one looked at 14. The people involved will be permanently denied access to Cedars-Sinai records even if they go on to work for other health providers, the hospital said.

Snooping in high profile cases has been a problem across the healthcare sector as we’ve seen many times. In this case, though, I’d point out that although the medical center’s system failed to prevent improper access, they seem to have detected it fairly quickly and responded firmly.  And although hospitals may train their employees on privacy and HIPAA, I can see where it may be more difficult for them to ensure that employees of community physicians provide sufficient background checks and ongoing privacy training to their employees.  Maybe we shouldn’t be surprised to see cases like this one and should be surprised that we don’t see this even more often.

Medical bills detailing “limited” personal information of 3,000 Centegra Health System patients recently were sent to the wrong addresses because of a mail room error at a third-party contractor, a Centegra spokeswoman said.

At the vendor MedAssets, automatic mail filing equipment was accidentally changed.

This led to two Centegra billing statements to be put in one envelope.

“Centegra Health System and MedAssets apologize for this error and are committed to fully protecting patient privacy,” Green said. “Centegra is working closely with MedAssets to ensure it has taken every step necessary to address the incident.”

Affected information included patient names, addresses, account numbers, original account balance, third-party payment, billing discounts and adjustments, and the amount owed. Hospital service dates, a summary of services provided and related charges were also included.

Green mentioned that even though 6,000 Centegra patients were affected by the error, half received two billing statements – One for  their own hospital service and the second for detailed another patient’s service.

There is no reason to believe that the exposed information was inappropriately used, she said.

His medical records â€” as are nearly all medical records in the U.S. â€” are private, guarded heavily by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

When, at 77, Mezzoni died a few months after his visit to Central Florida Regional, his wife had trouble acquiring the records for billing purposes.

She was shocked when she found out they were sold last month at a Salt Lake surplus store for about $20.

“I find it inexcusable,” said Susan Mezzoni, a nurse who lives in Lake Mary, Fla. “I don’t like that they’re out there.”

Along with 27 others, Louis Mezzoni’s records were unwittingly sold to a Salt Lake-area school teacher looking for a good deal on scrap paper for her fourth-grade class.

The packages were certified and sent via UPS, Ferrell said. When one of the boxes did not arrive, a Las Vegas auditor on Feb. 4 contacted hospital officials who, in turn, contacted UPS two weeks later.

Officials said they were unsure how the box made its way to Utah, though the package containing the records also had a document indicating it was “overgoods” â€” a package that was sold because the shipping company could not deliver it or find its owner.

 On June 9, 2014, Central Utah Clinic IT professionals discovered unauthorized individuals had compromised one of their servers. Each month, Central Utah Clinic successfully defends against numerous cybercriminal attacks. However, during this particular targeted attack, Central Utah Clinic security measures were circumvented.
 
 Following discovery of the compromise, the server was isolated to prevent further risk of unauthorized information disclosure. A thorough forensic investigation found no evidence that personal information was viewed or copied from the server to an unauthorized location. Additionally, there is no indication that any of the other 100+ Central Utah Clinic servers were compromised.
 
 The accessed server was not a complete database of patient information, but rather a limited subset of written imaging and radiology reports dated 2010 and earlier. The accessed server did store data on some individuals containing patient information with one or more of the following fields: name, date of birth, Social Security number, address and phone number.
 
 “Protecting our patients’ information from exposure of any kind beyond what is needed for treatment, and particularly from cybercriminal activity, is a key focus at Central Utah Clinic, and we take full responsibility for this incident,” said Scott Barlow, CEO of Central Utah Clinic. “These attacks are an unfortunate aspect of information technology and modern healthcare is not immune from this. It is important to understand there is no indication that any of our patients’ personal information was viewed or copied. Regardless, we are committed to transparency and working with our patients to mitigate possible effects of this occurrence.”
 
 Central Utah Clinic contacted appropriate regulatory authorities and has taken additional steps to safeguard patient information, including partnering with an advanced technology security firm and offering complimentary personal credit monitoring services to patients involved in the potential breach.
 
 Involved parties are being contacted by mail. Individuals who believe their information may have been involved or who need additional information should contact Central Utah Clinic toll-free at 1-844-714-0284.

2014,Centura Health,CO,HACK,Email,"May 01, 2014 - A data breach involving Mercy Regional Medical Center of Durango, Colo. exemplifies the stark reality that phishing attacks have become more complex and difficult for even the most shrewd of users to pick out.
 
 Mercy employees, according to the Durango Herald, were the target of a phishing email attack in which the hackers tried to obtain user names and passwords. Some employees, under the impression it was an authentic email, responded and provided their system login information. Exactly what entity, perhaps Centura, the hackers were posing as is unknown at this point.
 
 Centura Health, which owns Mercy, alerted 1,000 patients that their names, Social Security numbers, Medicare beneficiary numbers, addresses, dates of birth and phone numbers had been potentially accessed as a result of the hackers retrieving employee information. That list also includes protected health information (PHI) such as diagnoses, dates of service, names of a patient’s treating physician and medical-record numbers. The organization released a statement saying it is looking into the incident and brought in a forensics team to look at the affected employees’ email accounts. “When Centura learned of this, it was able to immediately stop the attack and began an investigation,” the statement read.
 
 More specifically, Centura Health said that it took immediate steps to implement and reinforce necessary protective measures to help prevent future occurrences. “Those steps included immediately stopping the attack, performing an investigation and hiring an outside forensics expert to assist, reinforcing education to all employees regarding ‘phishing’ emails and continuing to implement enhancements for strengthening user login authentication,” the statement read.

 Based in Coudersport, Pennsylvania, Charles Cole Memorial Hospital’s email breach affected 790 individuals’ protected health information.
 
 Charles Cole Memorial Hospital is classified as a Healthcare Provider.
 
 
 According to this report about Institute on UPMC’s statement:
 
 “We apologize for any concern or inconvenience that this may cause for our patients. I want to stress that patient care was never affected,” said UPMC Cole’s president and senior executive Ed Pitchford. “UPMC is committed to meeting our patients’ privacy expectations. We cannot confirm if any of the information was used for improper purposes, but, out of an abundance of caution, we deemed it appropriate to inform those possibly affected by this breach.”
 
 As a result of UPMC Cole’s internal investigation, it was determined that there were two phishing attacks (emails sent from an external source that look like they are from a trusted source attempting to obtain sensitive information and often contain links to a phony login page or fake website) on June 7 and June 14 that were discovered through staff reports of the receipt of the emails.
 
 The phishing attacks were isolated to email accounts and no medical records systems were breached. The following information was discovered in the emails to varying degrees for each patient, including patients’ names, dates of birth, scheduling information, types of procedures, names of providers and other general treatment information. No patient Social Security numbers were accessed during the phishing attacks.
 
 UPMC Cole has notified the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as required by the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that the information may have been accessed.
 
 UPMC Cole has sent letters notifying all of the patients affected.
 
 UPMC Cole has provided patients with information on how to place a fraud alert in their files with the three major credit-reporting companies, and has supplied them with links to access identity protection resources available through the Federal Trade Commission. UPMC Cole has also set up a toll-free telephone line with representatives who can answer questions from these patients and respond to any concerns.
 
 UPMC Cole took immediate corrective action by blocking the unwanted access.
 
 “We are committed to keeping patient information secure and strive to continually implement improvements to prevent such an incident from happening again,” Pitchford said.

2019,Cheyenne Regional Medical Center,WY,HACK,Email,"Cheyenne Regional Medical Center in Wyoming has recently learned that patient information may have been compromised as a result of a phishing attack discovered in April.
 
 The medical center was alerted to a potential security breach following the detection of suspicious activity related to employee payroll accounts on or around April 5, 2019. Around a week later, the medical center learned that employee email accounts had been compromised.
 
 The investigation revealed the attackers had gained access to employee email accounts between March 27, 2019 and April 8, 2019. The aim of the attack appears to have been to access employee payroll information, although patient information contained in email accounts may also have been accessed.
 
 The types of information potentially accessed varied from patient to patient and may have included names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, dates of service, provider names, medical record numbers, patient identification numbers, medical information, diagnoses, treatment information, and health insurance information. A very small percentage of patients also had financial information or credit card numbers exposed.
 
 The forensic investigation confirmed on August 21, 2019 that patient information was potentially accessed by the hackers, although at that stage of the investigation the full extent of the attack was not known. It took until November 1, 2019 before the medical center obtained a full list of the 17,549 impacted patients.
 
 There was a further delay sending notifications as up to date contact information was not held on a significant number of patients. Finding that information took time.
 
 The medical center explained that most patient information is stored in its electronic medical record system, but information is securely exchanged between staff members via email for administrative purposes and for consultations.
 
 Affected patients have now been notified by mail and have been offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services through Kroll.
 
 Cheyenne Regional Medical Center should be commended for its thorough explanation of the breach and investigation, and the reason for the 8-month delay sending notifications. All patients want to be notified of any exposure of their personal and health information quickly but will be unaware of the work involved in a breach investigation and how long it can take to find the information necessary to issue notifications. Such a detailed explanation will help patients to understand why it has taken so long to learn about the breach.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2019,CHI Health Orthopedics Clinic Lakeside,NE,HACK,Desktop Computer,"The Omaha, NE-based 14-hospital health system, CHI Health, has experienced a ransomware attack in which the protected health information of approximately 48,000 patients has potentially been compromised.
 
 The attack was discovered on August 1, 2019 and affected an old electronic health record system that contained the medical records patients who had received medical services at CHI Health’s Lakeside Orthopedic Clinic prior to April 2016.
 
 The investigation confirmed that a database used by the medical record system had been encrypted in the attack. A full investigation into the attack was launched and while it is possible that patient information was accessed or copied by the attackers, no evidence of unauthorized data access or data exfiltration was discovered and there have been no reports of misuse of patient information. The attack appears to have been conduced solely with the aim of extorting money from CHI Health.
 
 The types of information contained in the database included patient names, addresses, contact telephone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, diagnoses, treatment information, and other medical information.
 
 Affected individuals have been notified about the breach by mail and the incident has been reported to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights and other appropriate authorities.

2012,Children's Hospital Boston,MA,Theft,Laptop,"Boston Children's Hospital has agreed to pay $40,000 and bolster its patient data security following a data breach that compromised the personal information of more than 2,100 patients, the state attorney general's office announced Friday.
 
 The judgment, entered in Suffolk Superior Court, alleges the hospital failed to protect the health information of the patients, about 1,700 of whom were children.
 
 The data — including names, birthdates, diagnoses and surgery dates — was on a hospital-issued unencrypted laptop stolen from a doctor on official business in Argentina in May 2012. The information had been sent in an email from a colleague.
 
 Under the terms of the consent judgment, the hospital will pay a $30,000 civil penalty and a payment of $10,000 to a fund administered by the attorney general's office for educational programs concerning protected health information.
 
 ""Today's settlement will put in place and enforce important technological and physical security measures at Boston Children's Hospital to help prevent a breach like this from happening again,"" Attorney General Martha Coakley said.
 
 The hospital said it has already toughened security protocols.
 
 ""After this incident, we worked closely with the federal and state governments, as well as security industry experts, to ensure that Boston Children's security policies and technologies are state-of-the-art,"" the hospital said in a statement. ""Every device that is issued by Boston Children's is encrypted before it is used, and every employee must attest on an annual basis that his or her personal devices are also encrypted.""

 The hospital said a staff member’s email account “may have been accessed by an unauthorized party” on July 11. After a forensic investigation, it was determined that some of the potentially compromised emails contained names, addresses, dates of birth and phone numbers of patients, along with “limited clinical information, such as diagnosis and treatment received.”
 
 “Regrettably, this notice concerns an unintentional exposure of protected health information that may affect nearly 3,400 patient families,” Children’s said in its release.

2015,Children's Hospital Medical Center of Akron,OH,Loss,Other,"August 26, 2015 - PHI data breach notification letters were sent to over 7,600 Akron Children’s Hospital patients and families, according to a hospital press release. The health data breach involved a misplaced device containing information about medical transports between September 2014 and June 2015. Notification letters were sent out to 7,664 patients and families on August 21. The hospital discovered the breach on June 30.
 
 
 The missing device is a backup drive which contains voice recordings of conversations between dispatchers and hospital workers during the medical transport of Akron Children’s Hospital patients.
 
 Although there were no Social Security numbers or financial information disclosed in the breach, Akron Children’s Hospital states that some PHI became vulnerable. That information includes patient names, ages, gender, dates of birth, medical record numbers, location, medical transport times, physician, and chief medical complaints. Only patients who received a medical transport between the nine-month period listed above were affected by this breach.
 
 Akron Children’s Hospital maintains that there is no reason to believe that the information has been used maliciously, and that the device is not searchable and contains no other physician office data.

 The hospital press release expressed regret that such an event occurred.
 
 “We truly regret this situation and value the trust you and our other patient families place in us to care for your children,” the hospital states. “Akron Children’s Hospital is committed to maintaining our patients’ health information in a secure and confidential manner.”
 
 According to an article on WFMJ.com, a local news source, the device was stored in a locked location on the Akron Hospital campus. Despite those safeguards, the hospital has begun to administer additional protections to ensure an incident like this does not occur in the future. Going forward, Akron Children’s Hospital said it will be encrypting all of their mobile devices and will no longer use mobile devices to store transport voice recordings.
 
 Lost devices are an increasingly common issue for health data security. HealthITSecurity.com recently reported on a data breach at Lawrence General Hospital where a lost flash drive resulted in the compromise of patient lab data. The flash drive, which was reported as missing on June 9, contained information such as patient names, lab testing codes, and slide identification numbers.
 
 The hospital expressed regret for the incident via press release, and ensured the public that it was taking proper measures to ensure patient data security by reeducating its staff members.

2017,Children's Hospital of Los Angeles,CA,Theft,Laptop,"3,594 patients of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Medical Group (CHLAMG) are being notified of a potential breach of their electronic protected health information following the theft of an unencrypted, password-protected laptop computer.
 
 The laptop was stolen from the locked vehicle of a CHLAMG employee who practices at CHLA. The theft is understood to have occurred on October 18, 2016.
 
 CHLAMG encrypts its laptop computers, and while the investigation into the breach initially indicated the laptop had been encrypted to institutional standards, on December 21, 2016, CHLA determined that there was a possibility that the device had not been encrypted.
 
 Typically, laptops are stolen by thieves for the value of the device, not for data stored on the devices. Laptops are wiped, have software reinstalled, and are sold on.
 
 While it cannot be confirmed that this was the case in this instance, CHLA investigators were able to determine that the laptop computer has not been used to connect to the Internet since it was stolen, suggesting the device was wiped and ePHI is no longer accessible.
 
 A CHLA spokesperson said their IT security systems allow data on laptop computers to be remotely and securely erased. The protocol for doing this has been activated and data on the device will be wiped should the device be used to connect to the Internet. No evidence has been uncovered to suggest data have been accessed or used inappropriately. CHLA is continuing to work with law enforcement, although to date, the laptop computer has not been recovered.
 
 The data stored on the device included children’s names, addresses, medical record numbers, birthdates, and limited clinical information.
 
 Parents of affected children have been notified of the potential ePHI breach out of an abundance of caution. They have been advised to check Explanation of Benefits statements for medical services that have not been received.
 
 CHLA will be enhancing its encryption levels on all laptop computers used by its physicians to prevent future data breaches of this nature from occurring.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,60.0,3594.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2010,Children's Hospital of Orange County,CA,PHYS,Other,"Has your hospital looked at what's behind breaches of patient privacy? Two examples from California show just how easy it is to accidentally give unauthorized access to confidential patient medical records.
 
 The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) found that Children's Hospital of Orange County sent patient records to an auto shop in 2009, according to the Orange County Register. The business received six faxes containing healthcare information, including information that identified the patient's name, date of birth, and details about the visits.
 
 Hospital staff told the Register that a test fax should have been sent first, per hospital policy.
 
 In another breach of patient privacy by the same hospital, patient records were faxed to the wrong doctor, because the name of the patient's ER doctor was not correctly entered into the system. The hospital is checking its database for accuracy.
 
 In related news, the CDPH announced that five California hospitals were hit with administrative penalties and fines totaling $675,000, due to breaches of patient privacy. The fines ranged from $25,000 to $250,000. San Joaquin Community Hospital in Bakersfield was hit with a $25,000 fine after two employees gained unauthorized access to three patients' medical records. After one employee got unauthorized access to 204 patients' medical information, Community Hospital of San Bernardino was fined $250,000.
 
 In 2008, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed legislation to improve patient privacy and to address breaches of confidential information. SB 541 sets health facility fines for privacy breaches and ensured that healthcare providers face real consequences when they fail to protect patient privacy. Fines for facilities range up to $250,000 for each reported case in which private medical information is disclosed to unauthorized parties.

2010,Children's Medical Center of Dallas,TX,Loss,Other,"Children’s Medical Center of Dallas is run by Children’s Health, a Dallas-based healthcare system comprising three hospitals and numerous clinics in North Texas. On January 18, 2010, OCR was notified by Children’s Medical Center that a breach of patients’ electronic protected health information (ePHI) had occurred. The breach involved the loss of a Blackberry device containing the ePHI of 3,800 patients. The device had not been encrypted and was not protected with a password, allowing any individual who found the device to access the ePHI of patients.
 
 An investigation into the breach was launched on or around June 14, 2010. As part of the investigation, Children’s Medical Center provided OCR with a Security Gap Analysis conducted by Strategic Management Systems, Inc., (SMS) between December 2006 and February 2007. That analysis revealed a lack of risk management at Children’s Medical Center. In the report, SMS recommended that Children’s Medical Center implement encryption on portable devices such as laptop computers to prevent the exposure of ePHI in the event that a device be lost or stolen. Children’s Medical Center failed to act on that recommendation.
 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted an analysis of threats and vulnerabilities to ePHI in August 2008. In the PwC report, it was also recommended that Children’s Medical Center implement encryption on laptop computers, workstations, mobile devices, and portable storage devices such as USB thumb drives. PwC determined that the use of encryption was “necessary and appropriate.” Children’s Medical Center failed to act on PwC’s recommendations, even though encryption was rated as a “high priority” item.
 
 To OCR it was clear that Children’s Medical Center was aware of the risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI and that were was a lack of appropriate safeguards for ePHI at rest. Children’s Medical Center was aware of the risks as early as March 2007, more than a year before the security incident occurred and ePHI was exposed. Had Children’s Medical Center acted on the recommendations of SMS or PwC the breach could have been avoided.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.0,3800.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3217000.0,1.0
2013,Children's Medical Center of Dallas,TX,Theft,Laptop,"In addition to the lost Blackberry in 2010, Children’s Medical Center reported the loss of an unencrypted iPod containing the ePHI of 22 patients. The loss occurred in December 2010. On July 5, 2013, Children’s Medical Center notified OCR of another breach involving an unencrypted device. In this case, the laptop theft resulted in the exposure of 2,462 individuals’ ePHI.
 
 Even after the data breaches were experienced, Children’s Medical Center failed to act; only implementing encryption on portable devices in April, 2013. From 2007 to April 9, 2013, nurses were using unprotected Blackberry devices that contained ePHI, while other workers were using unencrypted laptop computers and mobile devices until April 9, 2013.
 
 Encryption of ePHI is not mandatory for HIPAA-covered entities. The use of encryption to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI is an ‘addressable’ issue.
 
 HIPAA-covered entities are required to conduct a comprehensive, organization-wide risk assessment to determine vulnerabilities that could potentially result in the exposure of ePHI. If, after performing the risk assessment, the covered entity determines that encryption is not ‘reasonable and appropriate’, the reasons why encryption is not deemed necessary must be documented and an equivalent measure must still be implemented to ensure ePHI is appropriately secured. Children’s Medical Center failed to document why encryption had not been used and also failed to implement an equivalent security measure.
 
 Furthermore, OCR determined that prior to November 9, 2012, Children’s Medical Center did not have sufficient policies and procedures governing the removal of hardware and electronic equipment from its facilities or movement of the devices within its facilities. Until November 9, 2012, Children’s Medical Center could not tell how many devices those policies and procedures should apply to: A full inventory was only completed on November 9, 2012. While devices had been inventoried prior to November 9, 2012, devices managed by the Biomedical department were not included in that inventory, breaching the HIPAA Security Rule (45 C.P.R. § 164.310(d)(l)).
 
 While efforts were made to resolve the HIPAA violations informally, Children’s Medical Center was unable to ‘provide written evidence of mitigating factors or affirmative defenses and/or its written evidence in support of a waiver of a CMP.’
 
 OCR determined that the violations were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect of HIPAA Rules. Had that not been the case, the penalty would have been considerably higher. OCR considered the fact that there had been no apparent harm caused to patients as a result of the lost devices, and chose the minimum penalty amount of $1,000 per day that the violations were allowed to persist.
 
 OCR’s Final Notice of Determination can be viewed on this link.
 
 According to OCR Acting Director Robinsue Frohboese, “Ensuring adequate security precautions to protect health information, including identifying any security risks and immediately correcting them, is essential.” Frohboese also explained that the lack of risk management can be costly for covered entities, “Although OCR prefers to settle cases and assist entities in implementing corrective action plans, a lack of risk management not only costs individuals the security of their data, but it can also cost covered entities a sizable fine.”",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,2462.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3217000.0,1.0
2014,Children's Mercy Hospital,MO,HACK,Other,"August 20, 2014 - Children’s Mercy Hospital of Kansas City, Mo. recently alerted 4,076 employees’ data may have been exposed in a breach involving its online scheduling application.
 
 According to the Kansas City Star, Children’s Mercy Hospital used the application two years ago to enroll employees and spouses onto its wellness program through StayWell Health Management. Though employee names, home and email addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth were loaded onto the app, no Social Security numbers or financial data were included. It’s unknown at this time how the data was breached.
 
 “We do not believe that affected individuals are at risk for identity theft, and we do not believe individuals need to take action due to the non-sensitive nature of the information,” Melissa Gilkerson, a StayWell spokeswoman, said, according to the Star.
 
 StayWell used a vendor, Onsite Health Diagnostics, to store the data and once OnSite learned that one of its systems had been compromised, it removed the data.

2017,Children's Mercy Hospital,MO,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"More than 5,000 Children's Mercy patients could be affected by a security incident. According to a notice posted on May 19, the hospital's information security department discovered an unauthorized website that contained health information for 5,511 patients. It may have included patients' name, medical record number, dates of service and notes, but did not include phone numbers, addresses, Social Security numbers or financial information.
 
 A physician had used the website to create an educational resource, believing the information was password-protected and inaccessible, but it did not meet the hospital's security standards.
 
 Children's Mercy stated that unauthorized third parties could have accessed the data, but the hospital is not aware of any misuse of information.
 
 The website has since been taken down. It was not owned by Children's Mercy and storing information on it was a violation of the hospital's policies.
 
 ""We take the protection of personal information seriously and have taken, and will continue to take, steps to prevent any such incidents involving personal information, including re-education and retraining of key staff to ensure full compliance,"" the hospital said in a statement to the Business Journal. ""These steps are in addition to our mandatory ongoing education for all employees regarding the privacy of patient information.""

2018,Children's Mercy Hospital,MO,HACK,Email,"Legal action has been taken over a phishing attack on Children’s Mercy that resulted in the theft of 63,049 patients’ protected health information.
 In total, five email accounts were compromised between December 2017 and January 2018. On December, 2, 2017 two email accounts were discovered to have been accessed by an unauthorized individual as a result of employees responding to phishing emails. Links in the emails directed the employees to a website where they were fooled into disclosing their email account credentials. Two weeks later, two more email accounts were compromised in a similar attack, with a fifth and final account compromised in early January.
 The mailbox accounts of four of those compromised email accounts were downloaded by the attacker, resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of patients’ protected health information. Patients were notified of the breach via a substitute breach notice on the Children’s Mercy website and notification letters were sent by mail. Due to the number of people impacted, the letters were sent out in batches. According to a recent article in the Kansas City Star, some patients have only just been notified that their PHI was stolen.
 In addition to the phishing attack, Children’s Mercy Hospital reported a further breach of 1,463 patients’ PHI to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights on June 27, 1018 – an unauthorized access disclosure incident. That incident related to the interception of unencrypted pages sent by physicians at the hospital. The pages were viewed by a radio hobbyist using an antenna and a software-defined radio (SDR) on a laptop computer. Children’s Mercy was not the only hospital affected by that incident.
 An unauthorized access/disclosure incident was also reported to OCR by Children’s Mercy Hospital on May 19, 2017. That incident impacted 5,511 patients. In that case, PHI had been uploaded to a website by a physician. The website was unauthorized and lacked appropriate security controls.
 Earlier this week, Kansas City law firm McShane and Brady filed a class action lawsuit over the phishing incident. In the lawsuit it is claimed that Children’s Mercy violated Missouri law and breached its fiduciary duty to patients.
 “Patients trust health care providers with our medical information and when that is released without our authorization, they’re breaking our trust and breaching what we’ve asked them to do,” said Maureen Brady, partner at McShane and Brady. “When we pay them for our treatment, part of that price point goes to training and computer software and records maintenance and making sure our privacy is kept.”
 While the lawsuit seeks damages for all patients impacted by the breach, those damages have not been stated in the lawsuit.
 This is not the first time that legal action has been taken against Children’s Mercy Hospital over a privacy breach, and neither is it the first time McShane and Brady has sued the hospital. The law firm also filed a class action lawsuit over the 5,511-record breach in 2017.
 There is no private cause of action in HIPAA, so it is not possible for patients to take legal action for the exposure of protected health information as a result of a HIPAA violation, although it is possible to sue healthcare providers over violations of state laws.",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0.0,63049.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
2015,Children's National Medical Center,DC,HACK,Email,"Children's National Health System is facing a potential class-action lawsuit following the hack of the personal data of up to 18,000 patients last year.
 Fardoes Khan, a longtime patient at Children's, filed the suit after receiving a letter in February from Children's informing her and other patients that their Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates and telephone numbers were compromised. Personal health data — including diagnosis, treatment received, medical record number, medical record service codes and health insurance information — were also part of the data breached.
 The suit, originally filed in Montgomery County, was moved to federal court last week.
 Children's has not immediately commented on the case but released the letter it sent to patients to the Washington Business Journal.
 The letter said the data breach was discovered Dec. 26, 2014, and occurred as a result of a phishing scam. Certain employees responded to emails they believed were legitimate but were actually from hackers, allowing possible unauthorized access to those individual email accounts from July 26, 2014, to Dec. 26, officials said.
 ""In a small number of instances, Social Security number were included,"" the letter read. ""Importantly, neither our patient charts nor our electronic medical records system were compromised. Only the discrete information contained in the email accounts was potentially affected.""
 The suit alleges Children's violated consumer and patient protection laws, making patients vulnerable to potential identity theft, credit damage, targeted marketing or increased medical insurance premiums based on private information. It seeks unspecified compensatory, statuary and punitive damages as allowed by law, along with credit monitoring services to those affected and training for hospital employees.
 Children's said it immediately secured the affected email accounts and hired an outside forensics company to assist in an investigation of the breach at the hospital. The breach was reported to federal authorities and is also being investigated by the FBI, hospital officials said.

2017,Chilton Medical Center,NJ,Theft,Other,"New Jersey-based Chilton Medical Center is warning patients their personal information may have been compromised after a former employee sold a stolen hard drive on the internet.
 The hospital, which is part of the not-for-profit Atlantic Health System, reported the breach to the Department of Health and Human Services, indicating that the incident impacted 4,600 people.
 On October 31, Chilton Medical Center discovered an employee sold a hard drive removed from a hospital computer, according to a statement posted on its website. The hard drive contained names, addresses and medical record numbers and medications, but the hospital stressed no financial information or medical records were affected.
 The hard drive contained information for certain patients that received care between 2008 and 2017, and the employee may have stolen hard drives from other computers.
 “During our investigation, we determined that the former employee removed other devices and assets from Chilton Medical Center to sell on the internet in violation of policy,” the statement read. “While we currently have no indication that any of these devices or assets contain patient information, we continue to investigate this incident and, if we determine additional patients are affected, we will notify them as appropriate.”",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,51.0,4600.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2019,Choctaw Nation Health Services Authority,OK,HACK,Email,"The Choctaw Nation Health Service Authority (CNHSA) is investigating a recent email phishing incident that may have involved patient information. This incident does not affect all CNHSA patients; only certain patients that received care at the Talihina Clinic location. On July 29, 2019, CNHSA learned of a phishing incident that resulted in the unauthorized access to an employee’s email account between July 24 and July 29, 2019. CNHSA immediately took steps to secure the account and began an investigation, and a leading computer forensic firm has been engaged to assist. The investigation is ongoing.
 As part of its investigation, CNHSA is in the process of reviewing the emails in the account to identify those patients whose information may have been accessible to the unauthorized person, as well as the nature of that information. CNHSA expects that some patient information is contained in the account, including patient names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and clinical information.
 CNHSA anticipates notifying affected patients in the coming weeks. Although CNHSA has no indication that any patient information has been misused, out of an abundance of caution, it has established a dedicated call center for patients to call with questions. If any patients have questions about this incident, please call 1-580-924-8280, ext. 4735, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Central Time.
 CNHSA also recommends that patients review the statements they receive from their healthcare providers. If they see services they did not receive, they should contact the provider immediately. To help prevent something like this from happening again, CNHSA is enhancing its email security and reinforcing education with employees on how to identify and avoid malicious emails.",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,5.0,550.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2018,CHRISTUS Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi Shoreline,TX,Theft,Paper/Films,"Patients of two HIPAA-covered entities received notification that their protected health information (PHI) was compromised due to burglaries. The first incident involved two Christus Spohn Hospitals in Corpus Christi. On April 16, 2018, an employee of Christus Spohn was burgled. The stolen PHI included the patients’ names, dates of service, dates of birth, ages, medical record numbers, account numbers and other health data. The Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers or other financial information of the patients were not compromised.
 The patients whose PHI was stolen were those previously treated at Christus Spohn Health System’s Memorial or Shoreline hospitals. The good news is, no report has been received yet regarding the misuse of the patients’ information. This breach incident has affected around 1,800 patients. The hospital has already taken the necessary steps to avoid the occurrence of a similar incident. The employee involved in the burglary also underwent additional training to make sure he fully understands what he must do to protect the PHI of patients.
 The second burglary incident happened in the Pacific Heights office of San Francisco acupuncturist Denise M. Bowden on April 28/29. Her office was ransacked and the thief stole a computer that contained some of her patients’ PHI. Ms. Bowden only knew about the incident on April 30, 2018. The compromised PHI included the names of patients, addresses, telephone numbers, diagnosis codes, dates of service and details of health insurance. Patients’ financial information or Social Security numbers were not stored in the computer.
 The stolen computer was protected by password, but patient information was not encrypted. Therefore, there is still the possibility that unauthorized persons can view the patients’ PHI. To date, there’s no report received that would indicate the access of information contained in the computer or its misuse. Ms. Bowen notified her patients by mail regarding the data breach on June 11, 2018.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,66.0,1805.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2012,CHRISTUS St. John Hospital,TX,Loss,Other,"Through the law firm of Baker & Hostetler, CHRISTUS St. John Hospital notified the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office of a breach involving unencrypted patient information on a lost memory stick.
The Houston-based hospital learned of the September 25th incident on September 27th, but a search was unsuccessful in recovering the drive, which contained the name, date of birth, Social Security number, health insurance information, diagnoses, and progress notes on patients in the St. John Sports Medicine Program. The total number of patients whose unencrypted data were on the lost stick was not reported, and this incident, reported to New Hampshire on November 16, has not (yet) shown up on HHS’s breach tool.
A notice about the incident is also linked from the hospital’s home page. The web site notice indicates that not all patients in the program are affected, only those who were treated from January 1, 2011 to July 31, 2012.
Both the notice and the letter to New Hampshire states that “St. John has no reason to believe that any of the information has been accessed…” How would it know that? Was there some program on the stick that would call home if files were opened or the stick inserted in a computer? If not, is it misleading to suggest that there’s no reason to believe the information has been accessed if there’s also no reason to believe that it hasn’t been accessed by someone who may have found the drive? And should a hospital claim it has no reason to believe the information has been used improperly? Does it have any reason to believe it hasn’t been used improperly? Did the hospital or its lawyers run credit checks and/or any investigations that would determine whether patients’ health insurance information had been misused by others? I really wish such reassuring platitudes were impermissible absent some actual investigation or offer of proof. But that’s just my opinion.
The hospital is offering a year of free credit protection monitoring and has set up a dedicated call center for affected patients or those who have questions.
CHRISTUS St. John Hospital is part of the CHRISTUS Healthcare System. In April 2005, CHRISTUS St. Joseph Hospital in Houston reported that it was notifying 16,000 patients that a computer stolen from its business associate, Gateway File Systems, contained medical records and Social Security numbers. The theft had occurred in January 2005, and the hospital claimed that the data were encrypted. In November 2008, CHRISTUS Healthcare System reported that two backup tapes with patient information had been stolen from an unattended vehicle in Houston. I do not know whether that latter breach also affected CHRISTUS St. John Hospital patients, but their statement at the time indicated that some patients in Houston were affected, as well as patients in other parts of Texas and other states.",1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,2.0,5748.0,574800.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2015,CHS Merit Health Northwest Mississippi,MS,Theft,Electronic Medical Record,"With big money to be made from the sale of Protected Health Information, and even bigger gains to be made from using the data for identity theft, many employees are tempted to access and copy medical records.
 In recent months numerous cases of data theft have reported by hospitals, and this week another has come to light, with the announcement by Merit Health Northwest Mississippi that one of its employees has stolen patient PHI.
 The now former employee’s acts were uncovered by local law enforcement officers, who notified the hospital of the potential data theft. An investigation into the security breach was initiated immediately to determine the extent of the theft. According to a statement released by Merit Health, the data access is believed to have started in February 2013 with the last data believed to have been removed in June 2015. The healthcare provider was notified of the privacy breach on July 1.
 The unnamed individual is understood to have accessed and removed the records of up to 810 patients over a period of more than two years without being discovered. The data potentially obtained includes patient names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, health plan identification numbers and some clinical information. Information relating to individuals who were responsible for the payment of medical bills may also have been compromised.
 Dianne Mitchell, the director of PR & Marketing for the hospital, said in an email about the incident, “Because the police investigation is ongoing, additional patients may be identified, and notification will be made to any individuals identified.”
 Under HIPAA Rules, breach notices must be issued to the media, breach notices issued to patients, and the Office for Civil Rights informed of the breach all within 60 days of discovery. With the deadline fast approaching, the hospital was obliged to announce the breach, even though further breach victims may still be identified.
 A breach notice has now been placed on the Merit Health website saying the employee was suspended while investigations were conducted, but that individual’s employment has now been terminated. Access to the healthcare provider’s facilities has similarly been terminated, as have access rights to hospital data.
 However, data appears to have been stolen for financial gain, and since the theft of data started more than two years ago, it is highly likely that a number of the 810 victims will have already suffered losses. Due to the high risk of financial harm, Merit Health Northwest Mississippi will be offering all affected patients free credit monitoring and identity theft resolution services.",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,880.0,846.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2010,Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center,OH,Theft,Laptop,"A password-protected laptop computer containing information regarding 61,027 Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center patients from multiple states and several foreign countries has been stolen.
 There has been no indication the information has been misused. Cincinnati Children’s is notifying each of the patients or their guardians by letters mailed May 28, 2010 and offering them free identity theft protection services.
 The theft occurred from an employee’s vehicle parked at his residence sometime between March 27 and 29, 2010. It was reported to the Cincinnati Police.
 Upon thorough investigation by the medical center, and third-party validation, Cincinnati Children’s concluded that the information on the laptop included some personal information, including names, medical record numbers, and services received. There were no social security numbers, telephone numbers or credit card information on the computer.
 The information on the laptop was password protected, but it was not encrypted.
 Since this event, Cincinnati Children's has strengthened its encryption practices to ensure no PC laptop computers are issued unless the encryption process is initiated. Additionally, it has improved its process for tracking the encryption of these laptops. Finally, it is committed to communicating safe electronic practices across the institution and rolling out updated training on securing and protecting patient information to all employees.
 “Cincinnati Children’s is committed to providing the highest level of care for its patients and their families and that includes protecting personal information,” Michael Fisher, president and CEO, wrote in the notification letter.
 The notification of the families, the federal department of Health and Human Services, the general public through a news release and posting on the hospital’s Web site are made pursuant to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act approved in 2009.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,61.0,61027.0,6099800.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2014,City of Hope,CA,STAT,Other,"The personal information of about 168,500 patients of the Los Angeles County departments of Health Services and Public Health was stolen during the theft of computer equipment from a firm that contracts with the county, authorities announced today.
 The theft took place Feb. 5 at the Torrance office of Sutherland Healthcare Solutions, Inc., which contracts with both departments, according to the county Department of Auditor-Controller.
 ""Sutherland immediately notified law enforcement and subsequently notified the County,"" according to a department statement.
 The company then ""began the process to identify the type of information or data"" stolen and on Feb. 25 confirmed to the county ""that the personal information of some DHS and DPH patients was stolen from their office, and their most recent analysis identified approximately 168,500 County patients who may be impacted,"" according to the department.
 The stolen data includes names, Social Security numbers, medical and billing information and possibly dates of birth, addresses and diagnoses, officials said.
 Sutherland began notifying individual patients by mail today that their information has been compromised and is offering them free credit monitoring and advice on how to protect themselves from potential identity fraud, according to the auditor-controller's office.
 ""In response to the incident, the County is working with Sutherland to review Sutherland's information privacy and security program,"" according to the department statement. ""In conjunction with the Countywide Information Security Program, the District Attorney's Cyber Investigation Response Team is working with the Torrance Police Department and other law enforcement agencies on this criminal investigation.""
 Beginning Friday, anyone who wants to know if their personal information was compromised can call Sutherland toll free at (877) 868-9284. 
 Among those affected by the burglary at Sutherland Healthcare Solutions were an undisclosed number of City of Hope patients. You can read City of Hope’s notification letter on the California Attorney General’s website. Patient information on the unencrypted computers included patients’ names, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, medical record numbers, account number and/or diagnoses.
 City of Hope noted that their contract with Sutherland incorporated strict privacy standards, and as a result of this incident, they have suspended business with Sutherland.
 Although Sutherland’s notice offered those affected free credit monitoring services through ID Experts, City of Hope’s letter offers its patients services through Kroll.
 Sutherland did not return a phone call from PHIprivacy.net yesterday asking them to clarify whether the 168,000 figure for Los Angeles County patients represented all patients who personal information may have been on the stolen computers.
 Update: A spokesperson for Sutherland confirmed that the 168k figure only applied to the L.A. County health system and did not include other entities that may have been affected by the breach, such as City of Hope. So the final number on the Sutherland breach is as yet unknown, as they did not disclose how many other covered entities may have been affected by this breach.",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1.0,168500.0,16850000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2016,City of Hope,CA,HACK,Email,"A phishing attack on California’s City of Hope Hospital has resulted in four staff email accounts being compromised. Three out of the four compromised email accounts contained a limited amount of protected health information, although the hospital does not believe the attack took place with a view to obtaining patient data. A press release from the Duarte hospital indicates the attack was most probably conducted in order to obtain contact information to use to send spam emails.
 A forensic data analysis organized by the hospital revealed that, in the majority of cases, patients only had their name and medical record number exposed. Some patients had more data exposed, including their date of birth, email address, telephone number, home address, dates of service, test results, and medical diagnoses. Only one Social Security number was exposed.
 The City of Hope Hospital phishing attack took place between January 18, and January 24, 2016. It is not clear how long it took security staff at the hospital to discover the attack, although prompt action was taken once the intrusion was detected to limit the damage caused.
 Email accounts were shut down and an external computer forensics company was hired to investigate the attack and determine the extent to which its systems had been compromised. The company also evaluated the hospital’s systems processes and helped the hospital strengthen its cybersecurity defenses to prevent future attacks from occurring. The forensic analysis was completed on February 18, 2016, after which breach notification letters were sent to affected patients. Local law enforcement has been alerted to the security breach as have the Office for Civil Rights and state agencies.
 The City of Hope Hospital phishing attack is just one of a large number of attacks on healthcare providers over the past few months. In this case the data exposed in the attack was minimal, but other healthcare providers have not been so fortunate.
 The incident highlights the importance of conducting regular staff training sessions to help employees identify phishing emails. A study conducted by Phishme in 2015 showed that phishing email identification exercises are a highly effective method of reducing risk. Training employees using mock phishing emails can help them to hone their phishing email identification skills, which can reduce the risk of malware being installed or sensitive data being revealed to scammers.",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0.0,1024.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2017,City of Hope,CA,HACK,Email,"A phishing attack on City of Hope has resulted in cybercriminals gaining access to the email accounts of four employees.
 The emails made it past spam filtering controls and were delivered to employees on May 31 and June 2, 2017. Four employees responded to the requests and disclosed their login credentials to the attackers. City of Hope says the emails appeared to have been sent from a trustworthy source.
 The attackers used the login credentials to access the accounts, although City of Hope was unable to determine the scope or nature of access. On July 21, City of Hope confirmed that three of the accounts contained patients’ protected health information.
 The protected health information in the emails included names, addresses, email addresses, contact telephone numbers, dates of birth, dates of service, diagnoses, test results, medication information, and other clinical data. No financial information, insurance details, or Social Security numbers were exposed or accessed.
 Phishing attacks such as this are not always concerned with obtaining protected health information. Oftentimes, access to the email accounts is gained in order to use the accounts to send spam emails. City of Hope believes that was the intention of the phishers in this case.
 However, since PHI access cannot be ruled out, patients affected by the incident have been advised to remain cautious and monitor their accounts for any sign of suspicious activity. The incident has been reported to law enforcement and a leading forensic information technology firm has been retained to assist with the investigation. The firm will also evaluate City of Hope systems and processes and will assist with strengthening existing security protections to prevent future incidents of this nature from occurring.
 The breach has now been reported to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The breach summary indicates 3,400 patients have been impacted by the incident.",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,51.0,3400.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The massive breach was cause by an automated mail merge program that accidentally pulled SSNs along with home address information, which was also forwarded to Aetna.
 “We regret that this happened, and I want to assure you that the university is taking immediate steps to mitigate the situation and to prevent a recurrence,” UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan said in a statement. “The protection of personal information of students, faculty and staff is a top priority. “The university has worked over the past several years to make sure confidential information and data are as secure as possible, and we remain committed to this effort.”
 UVA is starting to phase out the use of social security numbers as the primary identifier for its students, which may be a good idea now that 90% of its 21,000 students have had the information compromised. Affected students have been offered credit monitoring services.
 Clark Memorial Hospital in Jeffersonville, Indiana issued a statement apologizing for a third-party mailing company’s mistake that led to compromised personal health information for 1,087 patients.

2014,Clay County Hospital,IL,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"Federal and local law enforcement officials are investigating a healthcare data-for-ransom security breach at 18-bed Clay County Hospital in Flora, Ill.
 The hospital received an e-mail ransom demand Nov. 2 containing patient names, addresses, Social Security numbers and dates of birth, but no clinical information, according to a release.
 The sender threatened to make the patient information public unless “a substantial payment from the hospital” was made, the hospital statement said.
 The hospital's computer servers had not been hacked, the statement said. Records of hospital patients who visited on or before February 2012 were compromised, it said.
 Hospital spokeswoman Lisa MacKenzie said the records of 12,621 persons, all from Illinois, were affected. Where the breached records were stored, how far back in time they go and other details about the incident were withheld.
 “We're in the middle of an active investigation,” MacKenzie said “We're working with federal agencies as well as local police,” she said.
 Since September 2009, the records of more than 41.6 million individuals have been exposed in 1,186 breaches (involving 500 or more individuals' records) reported to the Office for Civil Rights at HHS and posted to its “wall of shame” website.
 While theft is the type of breach most commonly cited (52%) on the OCR's list, reports of ransom demands accompanying the thefts are rare, perhaps in part because the office doesn't track them separately.
 In 2012, an electronic crimes task force, part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, was called in to look for a hacker who encrypted the patient records of three Northern Illinois surgeons, then demanded payment for the decryption key.
 It's hard to say if ransom attempts are increasing, said security expert Mac McMillan, CEO of CynergisTek, because of a lack of public reporting.
 “It's seems like we've seen more this year,” McMillan said. “About a month ago I got a call from one of my CIOs who had a brother who worked for a firm that did billing for hospitals. They were hacked and all of their data was encrypted and held for ransom. We went back in and re-encrypted with special tools so they didn't have to pay the ransom. But it did affect their business.”
 Attacks on healthcare computer systems by hackers—which account for about 7% of the breaches on the wall of shame—particularly those traced to foreign, professional hacking groups, have been in the news of late.

2011,Columbia-St. Mary's Ozaukee Hospital,WI,INSD,Other,"Colleen Henry reports on a breach involving Columbia-St. Mary’s Ozaukee Hospital in Wisconsin that highlights some recurring problems with both breaches and breach notifications. I’m excerpting her excellent reporting to make a few points:
 Investigators said a janitor fed patient records to gang members. The lead investigator said a sworn statement that a janitor had access to a master key that opened most every room in the building, even though he had been a discipline problem.
 It’s how easily the janitor accessed the records that are causing alarm.
 While the hospital paid an outside firm to shred patient documents, records indicate the janitor accessed records from unsecured shredding boxes in the hospital with broken locks.
 Police believe the scheme went on for months before being discovered.
 This is not the first time we’ve seen a breach involving janitorial staff. In some cases, the staff were direct employees of the covered entity while in other cases, they were employees of a contracted service. But how well do you really investigate cleaning staff and the people with the keys to your kingdom?
 But four years after the breach was discovered, many patients still have no idea their personal information may have been stolen.
 Columbia St. Mary’s chose not to notify all its patients of the breach. They determined that only a few patients were affected.
 “This is a situation that involved less than 10 people,” said Columbia-St. Mary’s spokeswoman Deborah Friberg. “All of those individuals were notified at the time.”
 But the Sellers family was not told of the potential theft of their loved ones records.
 “The way my mother found out, through a third-party and not the hospital themselves after they knew this had happened, was appalling,” Sellers said.
 In this type of situation, the entity cannot really know with complete assurance whose data have been stolen because the breach went on for months before being discovered. The hospital may have known for sure that 10 people were affected, but could it really be sure no others were at risk? Could gang members have re-sold information to others who would use it at another time?
 The Sellers family sued Columbia-St. Mary’s for negligence and for violating their father’s right to privacy. The hospital fought the lawsuit arguing that it, too, was a victim of a rogue employee who violated work rules and there was not liable for negligence under Wisconsin law.
 The judge dismissed the Sellers’ case last month, finding that Columbia-St. Mary’s was not legally responsible for the misconduct of its janitor. The judge also ordered the Sellers family to pay the hospital’s legal costs- $30,000.
 I don’t know Wisconsin law, but saying that a firm is not responsible for the misconduct of its employee means that their assurances of privacy and security are pretty much b-sh*t. What are they saying, “We will keep your data secure and private, but you can’t be assured our employees will?”
 12 News obtained court documents that state the scheme went on for as long as eight months and investigators seized nearly 30 patient records in a sting operation.
 So were the other 20 patients notified by the hospital? HITECH may not have been in effect when the breach occurred by HIPAA went into effect in 1996. A hospital spokesperson told the reporter:
 “There was no rationale for doing something on a broader scale given the information we had at the time,” Friberg said.

2016,Comanche County Hospital Authority,OK,HACK,Email,"Comanche County Memorial Hospital (CCMH) is committed to protecting the privacy of its patients and maintaining the highest standards in patient confidentiality. Although there is a very low risk to patients, CCMH was recently notified that an incident occurred with patients of the Memorial Medical Group (MMG), affiliated with CCMH. This incident resulted in a limited amount of patient information being released.
 
 On February 26, 2016, the company contracted to provide patient satisfaction surveys for the MMG determined that an e-mail survey sent to numerous patients included incorrect information. The surveys were sent to the e-mail addresses of patients who visited MMG physicians from December 1 through December 31, 2015. The subject line of the e-mail stated the name of an individual that did not match the name of the individual to whom the e-mail was addressed. Within the body of the survey, the individual who received the e-mail was asked about their experience with a physician they had visited in recent weeks, but indicated that the physician worked in a different practice from the practice where the physician actually works. The surveys did not include any diagnoses or dates the physician was seen. They also did not contain any insurance or financial information of either the individual to whom the survey was sent or the individual whose name was in the subject line of the e-mail. They also did not include any identifying information about the individual other than the individual’s name. No social security numbers, addresses or phone numbers were disclosed.
 
 Upon the outside company’s discovery of the erroneous surveys, the Privacy Officer at CCMH was notified and a thorough internal investigation was conducted whereupon it was determined that the error as reported by the outside vendor was correctly identified. As a result of this error, the outside vendor is updating and revising its procedures to ensure this error does not occur again. The employees of the vendor who were responsible for the error received disciplinary action up to and including termination from employment. CCMH and the MMG are closely monitoring the ongoing performance of this vendor to determine whether its services will be continued. Services will only be continued if they can be certain that the cause of the error has been satisfactorily corrected by the vendor.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0.0,2199.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2007,Concord Hospital (via Verus Inc.),NH,DISC,Other,"Names, addresses, birth dates, phone and Social Security numbers of more than 9,000 Concord Hospital patients were exposed on the Internet for more than a month and the hospital’s president said there’s no way of knowing whether any were poached by criminals.
 The hospital sent letters Friday notifying 9,297 patients and confirmed the breach Saturday to the Concord Monitor. A statement posted Sunday on its Web site said Concord Hospital was working to ensure no future security lapses.
 Concord Hospital said Verus, Inc., an online billing contractor based in Bellevue, Wash., disabled an electronic firewall protecting the information on April 12 to perform maintenance, then inadvertently left if off. Verus notified Concord Hospital of the breach on May 30.
 Concord Hospital president and CE0 Michael Green said credit card and medical data were not exposed. However the hospital urged patients to take steps to protect themselves against fraud and identity theft because the personal information was accessed eight times.
 “We have no way of knowing if anybody would have taken the database and would be trying to use it for any illegal purposes,” he said.
 Green said the hospital waited a week to notify patients because it wasn’t clear how many people were affected until Thursday and wanted to investigate on its own.
 “We needed to do our own research so we could identify exactly who was affected,” Green said. “We also did some of our own research to try to make sure we understood the extent of the problem, and so it did take the better part of a week and then, of course, we have to draft a letter and get the letter in the mail.”
 The hospital sent the letter and notified the attorney generals consumer protection bureau on Friday. Officials recommended that patients place fraud alerts on their credit files by contacting one of the three major credit reporting agencies.
 “We responded as quickly as we could once we became aware of the situation,” Green said. “I am truly sorry for any inconvenience this will cause for any of our patients.”
 Concord Hospital is the only New Hampshire hospital affected by the breach, he said.
 Green said the security lapse was due to human error; the hospital is talking to lawyers and looking for a new online billing provider. In the meantime, it has indefinitely disabled its “my bill” Web payment option.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,48.0,9297.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 Issue:
 Based on interview and record review, the hospital failed to protect the confidential medical information of 4709 patients (Patients 1-4709) of 4709 patients reviewed, as evidence by: Protected patient information contained in a meeting agenda report and pertaining to 4700 patients was published on a public website on the Internet (Patients 10-4709),Following healthcare visits, protected patient information pertaining to Patients 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 9 was disclosed to other patients;Patient 3's lab result was mailed to another patient. Patients 7 and 8 had their protected information disclosed to another patient when their discharge papers were given to that patient by staff. These failures caused patients loss of dignity and privacy, and placed them at risk for identity theft. Findings:Review on 2/24/12 of facility policy ""Safeguarding Protected Health Information"", dated 4/14/2003 and revised 7/1/2010, showed that the policy instructed staff, "" Workforce members must take precautions to prevent the unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of health system identification card itself, any document embossed with this information, or any document with this information written on any part of it. "" The policy further instructed staff that they, "" must be very careful to give the correct health system identification cards and paperwork to the proper patient. ""During an onsite visit and interview with the hospital privacy officer (PO) on 2/23 and 2/24/12 the following were noted:1. On 11/23/11, the hospital was made aware that a report attached to a meeting agenda was posted on line, on the Internet. Included in this report were the names, the account numbers and the amount to be discharged as uncollectable of 4700 individuals who had received health care delivered by the hospital. Review on 2/24/12 of a copy of the ""Health Services Write -Off Report "" showed 83 pages listing patient names, account numbers, and payment balances.2.

2019,Conway Medical Center,SC,HACK,Electronic Medical Record,"Conway (S.C.) Medical Center is notifying 2,550 patients of a phishing incident that may have exposed their protected health information.
 
 In October, Conway Medical Center determined that an unauthorized third party had gained access to a limited number of employee email accounts. Immediately, the hospital suspended the unauthorized access and began an investigation.
 
 Patient data that may have been exposed included names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, dates of admission/discharge, account numbers and amounts owed. The hospital's medical record system was not affected.
 
 There is no evidence that patient information has been misused.
 
 ""We recommended affected persons activate the protection services offered, and as always, remain vigilant and monitor account statements and credit reports carefully. Individuals should report discrepancies to law enforcement. Fraud alerts and security freezes also can be activated to help protect individuals,"" Conway Medical Center said in a statement.The email accounts of several staff members of Conway Medical Center in South Carolina have been obtained by unauthorized persons.
 
 The phishing attack was first discovered on October 7, 2019 and impacted email accounts were immediately secured to stop additional unauthorized access. External cybersecurity experts were engaged to review the breach and determine whether patient information had been viewed or downloaded. The investigators found that the first email accounts were compromised in or before July 2019.
 
 It was not until November 20, 2019 that the investigators confirmed that the protected health information of patients had been exposed as each email had to be checked to determine whether it contained PHI and if it had been obtained or viewed. That was largely a manual task.
 
 The way the email accounts were accessed meant emails may have synchronized with the hacker’s computer and could have been automatically obtained.
 
 Those emails included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birth dates, phone contact numbers, dates of admission, discharge dates, CMC account numbers, monies owed, and other data. For certain patients, the names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, place of employment, and other details relating to their guarantors was also possibly obtained.
 
 Steps have now been taken to strengthen email security and notification letters have been mailed to affected patients. Individuals whose financial data has been exposed have been offered complimentary identity theft protection services.
 
 The breach report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights indicates 2,550 patients have been affected by the security breach.

 A business associate (BA) of the covered entity (CE), Conway Regional Medical Center, sent the CE two compact disks containing scanned medical records which were mislaid following receipt. The protected health information (PHI) involved in the breach included the demographic and financial information of 1,472 individuals. The CE provided breach notification to HHS, the media, and affected individuals. Following this breach, the CE instructed its BA to encrypt any removable media that contains PHI and hand deliver the removable media to the CE’s Medical Records Department. Further, the CE improved administrative safeguards by updating its policy and procedures, which now requires a signature of an employee in the receiving department when packages are delivered. Also, all workforce members in the department involved in the breach attended additional HIPAA training. As a result of OCR’s investigation, the CE no longer routinely sends PHI off site for scanning.

2017,Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS),IL,Unauthorized Disclosure,Network Server,"Cook County Health and Hospitals System, a health system comprising two hospitals and more than a dozen community health centers in Cook County Illinois, has alerted patients to a breach of their protected health information.
 
 The breach occurred at Experian Health, a business associate of Cook County Health and Hospitals System. Experian Health is contracted to determine insurance eligibility and limited patient information is disclosed to the business associate for this purpose.
 
 The breach occurred in March 2017 during an upgrade of Experian Health’s computer system. The protected health information of 727 patients was accidentally sent to other healthcare systems. The PHI disclosed was limited and did not include the types of information sought by cybercriminals to commit identity theft.
 
 Due to the limited disclosure of PHI, and the fact that the information was sent to organizations covered by HIPAA Rules, the risk to patients is believed to be low. To date, Experian Health has not been notified of any unauthorized uses of the disclosed information. The breach was limited to patients’ names, medical record numbers, dates of birth, and account numbers.
 
 Following discovery of the breach, Experian Health took steps to recover and secure the disclosed information and steps have been taken to prevent similar incidents from exposing the PHI of patients. Cook County Health and Hospitals System also reviewed the breach and is satisfied with the actions taken by Experian Health to prevent similar breaches from occurring in the future.
 
 Cook County Health and Hospitals System was notified of the breach on August 1, 2017 and a substitute breach notice was posed on the health system’s website on October 2, 2017.

 By LISA SCHENCKER
 CHICAGO TRIBUNE |
 NOV 14, 2017 | 11:42 AM
 
 The federal government is investigating a security lapse that exposed the personal information of more than 700 patients at Cook County Health and Hospitals System this year.
 
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights has listed the data exposure among its current investigations.
 The hospital system publicly acknowledged the incident in a news release in October, saying that it was notified by Experian Health in August that Experian mistakenly sent patient information to other health care facilities during a computer system upgrade in March.
 
 That information included names, account numbers, medical record numbers and birthdays. Addresses, Social Security numbers and clinical information were not exposed in the incident, according to the hospital system.
 
 Experian works with the hospital system to help it determine patients’ insurance eligibility.

 So far, there’s been no indication that any patient information was misused, said Alexandra Normington, a spokeswoman for Cook County Health, in an email.
 She said Cook County Health was “one of many health care organizations impacted by the Experian breach.”
 
 Experian said in a statement provided by spokesman Michael Troncale on Monday that the incident was not a true data breach “but an isolated processing error.” Patient information was sent only to other health care organizations that must also comply with a federal law preventing them from disclosing personal patient data, according to Experian.
 
 “As soon as this was discovered, Experian took immediate action to correct the error,” according to the statement.
 
 Southern Illinois Healthcare also reported, in June, that personal information of more than 600 of its patients was potentially exposed as part of the Experian incident.",1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,140.0,727.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2015,Cottage Health,CA,DISC,Other,"November 27, 2017 - Cottage Health System recently reached a $2 million settlement with the California Attorney General’s office after two separate health data breach incidents that took place in 2013 and 2015.
 
 In total, more than 50,000 patients had their medical information publicly available from the data breaches.
 
 “When patients go to a hospital to seek medical care, the last thing they should have to worry about is having their personal medical information exposed,” Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “The law requires health care providers to protect patients' privacy. On both of these counts, Cottage Health failed.”

 State Data Breach Notification Laws Critical to Healthcare Orgs
 $115M Settlement Proposed in Anthem Data Breach Case
 Tech Company Agrees to $264K Vermont Data Breach Settlement
 The first incident took place in 2013 when Cottage was notified that a company server containing medical records for over 50,000 patients was connected to the internet without encryption, password protection, firewalls, or permissions that would have prevented unauthorized access.
 
 Exposed information included medical history, diagnosis, laboratory test results, and medications.
 
 Two years later, Cottage experienced a second health data breach while the state attorney general was investigating the 2013 incident. In the second Cottage health data breach, 4,596 patient records were accessible online for approximately two weeks. This incident involved PII and ePHI, including medical record numbers, account numbers, names, addresses, Social Security Numbers, employment information, admit and discharge dates, and other personal information.
 
 “Cottage’s data breaches were symptoms of its system-wide data security failures,” stated the conformed complaint against Cottage. “Cottage failed to employ basic security safeguards, leaving vulnerable software unpatched or out-of-date, using default or weak passwords, and lacking sufficient perimeter security, among many other problems.”
 
 The complaint also explained that the security assessments following the first data breach revealed that Cottage’s external and internal information systems were “significantly compromised.”
 
 “Cottage was running outdated software, failing to apply software patches, not resetting default configurations, not using strong passwords, failing to limit access to sensitive PII, and failing to conduct regular risk assessments, among other things,” the document read.
 
 The data breach from 2015 also involved a server that was internet-accessible and was not protected with a firewall, the complaint maintained. Misconfigured server settings reportedly led to the server being accessed “by a limited number of other unidentified parties.”
 
 Along with paying the $2 million penalty, Cottage must also upgrade its data security practices, according to the California Attorney General.
 
 “Cottage Health is required to protect patients’ medical information from unauthorized access and disclosure and to maintain an information security program that meets reasonable security practices and procedures for the healthcare industry,” the attorney general statement said. “It must designate an employee to serve in the capacity of a Chief Privacy Officer and to complete periodic risk assessments.”
 
 Specifically, Cottage must “maintain reasonable security practices and procedures to protect patients’ medical information from unauthorized access and/or disclosure, including access by or via internet search engines,” the California court’s final judgement explained.
 
 Cottage will also need to ensure its information security program does the following:
 
 Assess hardware and software used within Cottage’s computer network for potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patients’ medical information, and updating security settings and access controls where appropriate
 Evaluate the response to and protections from external threats, including firewall security
 Encrypt patients’ medical information in transit in accordance with health care industry best practices
 Maintain reasonable policies and protocols for all information practices regarding data retention, internal audits, security incident tracking reports, risk assessments, incident management, and remediation plan
 Conduct periodic vulnerability/penetration testing designed to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities within Cottage’s computer network
 Train employees regarding the collection, use, and storage of patients’ medical information.
 The healthcare organization is also required to complete an annual privacy risk assessment for the next two years. Cottage will explain how it is addressing its compliance with applicable privacy laws over PHI security and on the effectiveness of its information security program. Cottage Health System notified 11,000 of its patients on Tuesday to advise them that some of their Protected Health Information (PHI) was exposed as a result of a server incident that occurred in late October, 2015.
 
 For 14 days, patients had their Social Security numbers, details of medical diagnoses and procedures, and their names and addresses exposed as a result of protections being removed from a server. A statement released by Cottage Health indicates no financial information or Driver’s license numbers were exposed in the incident
 
 The security breach was discovered on 8th November and resulted in the affected server being taken offline and secured. Upon investigation, Cottage Health determined that patient data first became accessible on October 26, 2015.
 
 An external computer forensics firm has been contracted to conduct a full investigation into the security breach to determine whether any of the data were accessed during the period they were accessible. At this present moment in time, no information has been released to indicate whether the security breach was caused by an external third party or an internal error.
 
 It does not appear that any data have been accessed during the time they were accessible, although the full forensic investigation should clarify this, as well as the level of risk faced by affected patients.
 
 Santa Barbara-based Cottage Health System serves patients in Southern California through its network of 5 hospitals: Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital, Cottage Children’s Medical Center, Santa Ynez Valley Cottage Hospital and Cottage Rehabilitation Hospital. This is not the first time its patients have had their privacy violated as a result of a server incident of this nature.
 
 Two years ago, the health system discovered server protections had been inadvertently turned off. That security breach was the result of an error made by one of the health system’s business associates, InSync Computer Solutions, Inc. The security breach was initially thought to have affected 32,500 patients, although a further 18,418 patients were subsequently discovered to have also been affected. As a result of the removal of security protections, patient PHI was indexed by Google.
 
 A lawsuit was filed against the health system for the exposure of patient PHI, which Cottage Health settled for $4.125 million. A large proportion of that settlement was due to be paid by the health system’s insurance company, Columbia Casualty. However, Columbia Casualty sued Cottage Health claiming numerous security failures contributed to the cause of the breach. The insurance policy required Cottage Health to implement a number of controls to reduce risk.

 This notice is posted pursuant to federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 breach notification regulations found at 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act Section 13402(e)(1). 
 
 On Nov. 5, 2013, it was discovered that a Coulee Medical Center employed physician had shared certain patient information with his wife. The information shared includes: patient account number (a number used solely by the hospital for purposes of identification), date of service, CPT code and description of health care services that the patient received at Coulee Medical Center. The information that was accessed may have, in some instances, also included the patient’s name.
 
 Coulee Medical Center has taken measures to prevent further access to this information. Coulee Medical Center is committed to providing quality care and protecting patients’ personal information, and apologizes for the inconvenience and concern this may be for affected patients.
 
 The affected patients will receive direct mail correspondence from Coulee Medical Center. If you have questions about this incident or concerns about how it may impact you, please contact the Coulee Medical Center Privacy Officer at (509) 633-1753.
 
 Although I haven’t yet found a copy of the actual notification letter mailed to patients, at least one recipient was not appreciative at all. And the doctor in question, who reportedly was not named in the letter sent to patients, publicly responded and indicated that he felt the medical center had unfairly tarnished his reputation:
 
 In an interview, Dr. Andrew Castrodale said the “HIPAA” notice, made under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, implied the work had been about figuring out bonus pay, but was actually meant to devise a reliable tool for measuring and reporting the efficiency and productivity of health care providers at Coulee Medical Center.
 
 Although it did not name Castrodale, the “Notice of Patient Privacy Breach” that arrived in mailboxes Jan. 3 and 4 said the doctor had improperly shared patient information with his wife.
 
 Castrodale said his wife, Sherril, is an actuary, and was helping him build a standardized statistical tool that could be used by Coulee Medical Center.
 
 “None of this has to do with anyone’s medical history,” he said.
 
 I find it somewhat shocking that a physician would suggest that PHI that includes CPT codes, description of services, and in some cases, patients’ names, is not covered by HIPAA or that this was not a big deal – particularly in a small town where people might be recognized by unusual conditions or services.
 
 In any event, unless the physician wishes to claim that PHI is not PHI, it seems hat the doctor shared patients’ PHI with his wife without authorization or consent of the patients. However noble his intentions, and however much he believes the medical center may have misrepresented his motivation, unless he had consent or a HIPAA waiver, I think it’s pretty clear he did violate HIPAA’s Privacy Rule.
 
 That said, was the hospital’s notification accurate and appropriate? Did they have an obligation to explain to recipients that the disclosure to the doctor’s wife was reportedly so she could provide actuarial advice? Was this, as some of have suggested, a political dirty trick to discredit the doctor? The incident wound up contributing to the medical center hiring new legal counsel:
 
 A majority of hospital district commissioners voted Thursday to immediately hire new legal counsel, then went into closed session with the new attorney.
 
 Commissioner Jerry Kennedy said the board’s reasons for changing attorneys had been compounded the week before when the hospital administration mailed a notice of a privacy breach, reportedly to thousands, saying a doctor had violated federal patient privacy rules.
 
 “One of the hopes that I had was that … having legal counsel involved in that would help minimize reputational damage to the institution and to staff that might be potentially involved,” Kennedy said. “I didn’t feel, as a lot of people didn’t feel, that that happened.”
 
 The HIPAA notice, made under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, came at a time when the hospital administration has been at seemingly irreconcilable odds with its doctors, who have expressed no confidence in administration.
 
 So how does a political controversy factor into a HIPAA breach notification? It shouldn’t, of course, and if the medical center did not give patients the information they needed to assess their risk of harm because of any secondary or political agenda, then that’s problematic.
 
 I’d love to see what HHS does with this one if they get all the facts. But this is also a useful reminder of why covered entities should consult with lawyers and experts on breach response before making any statements or sending out any notification letters. There’s an update to the Coulee Medical Center breach, where 2,500 patients were notified that a physician had improperly shared PHI with his wife between January 2010 and November 2013. He subsequently claimed that his wife, an actuary, was helping him develop a statistical tool for analyzing data. Even so…
 
 From HHS’s summary of their investigation:
 
 “The covered entity (CE), Coulee Medical Center, reported that a CE-employed physician disclosed electronic protected health information (ePHI) to his wife without authorization. The ePHI involved in the breach included names, hospital account numbers, dates of service, CPT codes, and service descriptions for approximately 2,500 individuals. The CE provided breach notification to HHS and affected individuals. Upon discovering the breach, the CE sanctioned the physician, required the physician to complete comprehensive HIPAA training, and required all workforce members to complete annual HIPAA training. As a result of OCR’s investigation, the CE implemented new information security policies and procedures to better safeguard its ePHI. OCR provided the CE with technical assistance regarding what constitutes an adequate Security Rule risk analysis and risk management plan, as well as what constitutes adequate notice to the media pursuant to the Breach Notification Rule.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0.0,2500.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

 The majority of patient records are for individuals who were treated at the Hawkins facility between 2011 and 2015. The exposed medical records likely included information such as names, medical record numbers, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, diagnoses, dates of admit, insurance carriers, insurance identification numbers, and Social Security numbers. Other personal data, including driver’s license information, may also have been compromised.
 
 The facility said it will offer one free year of identity theft protection to affected patients, and that it will continue to work with law enforcement “on all aspects of the criminal investigation.”
 
 The nurse who allegedly took the documents has resigned and is no longer working at the hospital, Los Angeles County Department of Health Services spokesman Michael Wilson told the LA Times. The nurse’s name was not released.

The employee was subsequently terminated.
 
 The details of the situation are explained in a letter from Covenant HealthCare Privacy Officer Rebecca Schultz to MLive/The Saginaw News dated Thursday, Jan. 19. It reads in part, ""As part of our regulatory requirements, I am writing to let you know that Covenant HealthCare has submitted a report today that certain personal and medical information concerning a limited number of patients was inappropriately accessed by a former employee. Covenant has mailed letters to notify each individual who may have been affected.""
 
 It continues, the former Covenant employee's misconduct was discovered ""after detecting an unusual pattern of accessing patient records in Covenant's electronic medical record (EMR) system, Covenant opened a prompt review and regrettably learned that one of its employees accessed, without a legitimate business reason, information about certain patients and the services they received at Covenant. Covenant has been diligently investigating the matter since learning of it.""
 
 According to the letter, Covenant discovered on Nov. 21, 2016, that the inappropriate access occurred during the former employee's employment with Covenant from Feb. 1, 2016 through Nov. 21.
 
 
 Information the former employee may have accessed includes patients' full names, birth dates, home addresses, medical record numbers, health insurance information, diagnostic and treatment information, driver's license numbers and Social Security numbers.
 
 Covenant spokesman Larry Daly said letters were mailed to affected patients Friday, Jan. 20.
 
 Daly said the 6,197 patient records that were inappropriately viewed represent ""much less than 1 percent"" of Covenant's total medical records. ""But this is an important issue to those 6,197 folks,"" he added.
 
 Covenant officials say they have not received any reports of identity fraud, theft or specific misuse of the patient information. However, as a precaution, Covenant is providing credit monitoring and identity theft protection to patients whose Social Security numbers may have been accessed, the letter states.

 On June 2, 2017, the UC Health Privacy Office learned that an employee of the Cincinnati-based healthcare center had accessed patient health records – without proper authorization – between July 29, 2015 and June 2, 2017.
 
 According to a statement released by the healthcare center, approximately 4,721 patients may have been affected by the breach. 
 
 However, DDC stated no patient Social Security numbers were included in the accessed medical records.
 
 The employee responsible for the breach has since been terminated upon confirmation of the instance of unauthorized access.
 
 DDC began mailing advisory notices to potentially impacted patients on August 1, 2017. The healthcare center has also established a dedicated call center to answer any questions from concerned patients.
 
 DDC is also extending one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to any patients seeking additional security measures.
 
 Following the incident, DDC has implemented additional security controls to periodically monitor EHR access at the facility. Additionally, DDC is conducting in-depth information security training and education with all staff regarding appropriate EHR access and the importance of patient confidentiality. 
 
 With EHR adoption nearly ubiquitous in hospitals and health systems nation-wide, unauthorized EHR access has become a persistent security problem in recent years.
 
 According to the OCR data breach reporting database, unauthorized patient medical record access was the leading cause of security incidents in the first half of 2016.
 
 Of 114 security incidents reported to the federal agency between January 1 and June 1 of last year, 47 were classified as being related to unauthorized access or disclosure of patient information.
 
 The largest healthcare data breach during that time period was the result of an instance of unauthorized access by a third party at 21 Century Oncology, potentially impacting 2,213,597 patients.

 An encrypted disc and hardcopy documents containing the personal identification information were lost by a consultant company -- Mercer Human Resources Consulting -- that reviews the DCH pension plan to determine the annual employer contribution requirements.
 Neither Mercer nor DCH were aware of any of the information being accessed or illegally misused.
 Mercer notified DCH on March 22 that a package of documents containing retirement benefit information had disappeared. The pension documents had been mailed from Mercer offices in Birmingham March 2, but disappeared after reaching its intended destination in Louisiana.
 It was about a week before Mercer knew the package was missing, said Charles Salmans, a Mercer spokesman.
 While tracking data indicates the package was delivered to the addressee’s building, the intended recipient never received the package.
 “It was sent without requiring the addressee to sign for it, which should not have happened,” Salmans said, noting the matter is still under investigation.
 DCH employees were notified of the security breach Thursday. The situation puts anyone on the payroll at DCH Regional Medical Center, Northport Medical Center or Fayette Medical Center in 2006 at risk for identity theft. Additionally retirees, former vested participants, surviving spouses of retirees or vested participants are at risk. A letter was mailed to all those affected.
 Mercer, an entity of the Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc., has taken full responsibility for the incident and is covering the costs monitoring the affected individuals for identity theft for a year. The identity protection program is being provided by another Marsh & McLennan entity, Kroll. All those affected have been told how to request a free copy of their credit reports.
 DCH waited until the deal for the identity protection program was in place before announcing the security breech.
 “We felt it was best if we could tell our employees of the issue and solution at the same time,” said Brad Fisher, DCH spokesman. “It took time for [Kroll] to log our names into the system and for us to prepare the mailing to go to the employees.

 Salmans said a police report has been filed but he didn’t know with what authority. He did say that an outside carrier and not the U.S. Postal Service sent the package, so federal authorities are not involved. Salmans said he wasn’t prepared to identify the company used to mail the package.

 Laptop, containing patients' SSN, missing from Deaconess
 December 27, 2006
 By Kim Dacey and Rachel Chambliss
 
 Deaconess Hospital administrators are advising patients Tuesday night that their identity may have been compromised after a laptop, containing information on 128 patients, is missing and presumed stolen from the respiratory therapy department.
 
 Deaconess employees discovered the laptop was missing in late November. They searched for the computer, and still don't know if it really was stolen or just missing.
 
 So to be on the safe side, they sent out a letter to all 128 patients telling them they could be at risk for identity theft.
 
 Deaconess officials say the only patients at risk were given respiratory treatments on July 18 and 19 of this year.
 
 But the good news is the laptop was password protected. So only Deaconess employees were able to access it.
 
 But since that information includes patients Social Security numbers, they wanted to make those patients aware.
 
 Right now, they aren't sure who last had the computer or who might be a suspect.
 
 Statement from Deaconess Hospital:
 
 Deaconess Hospital reports that a laptop computer used in its Respiratory Therapy Department is missing and presumed stolen. The laptop may have contained private information on up to 128 patients.
 
 The laptop was used to record medical and personal information in patient medical charts. The computer was password protected, making it unlikely that anyone but certain Deaconess Hospital employees could access the information stored on the computer.
 
 Deaconess does not have any information indicating the computer was stolen for the purpose of identity theft or that the information on the computer has been misused to date.
 
 In a letter sent December 23, Deaconess notified 128 patients that their information may have been on the computer. Deaconess recommended that these patients take the following steps to protect themselves against identity theft:
 
 * Monitor bank, credit card and other bills/statements in detail for the next two years.
 * Contact credit card issuers and inform them of what has taken place.
 * Obtain a credit report from each of the credit reporting bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion). Each credit reporting bureau is required by law to provide each person one free credit report per year. The Credit Bureau Central Source can be contacted at 1-877-322-8228.
 * Visit the Federal Trade Commission Web site at www.consumer.gov/idtheft. This site has several pages with advice for reducing opportunities for identity theft.
 
 Deaconess has taken several steps to prevent future incidents of this nature, including establishing a Security/Privacy Team to install encryption software on computers and tightening procedures and monitoring systems.

The theft was reported to the police and immediately investigated.
 
 We are sorry this happened and want to provide pertinent information concerning the occurrence along with the steps we are taking to minimize any potential impact.
 
 We have identified 3,288 patients who may have been affected. We are notifying each of the patients or their guardians by letters mailed December 18, 2010. Care was received at Dean and St. Mary’s Hospital or the St. Mary/Dean Surgery & Care Center.
 
 Upon our own thorough investigation and our attempts to identify the affected patients, we determined that the information on the laptop included some protected health information relating to a surgical procedure. The information was limited to the patient’s name, date of birth, medical record number, name of procedure and related diagnosis, date of service and, in some cases, pathology data. The laptop did not contain any Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, or financial information of any kind.
 
 We have no reason to believe the laptop was stolen to gain access to patient information or that this information has been accessed or misused in any way.
 
 Both Dean and St. Mary’s Hospital are undertaking comprehensive reviews of this breach of policy and are instituting an information and re-education initiative to ensure that all employees and providers protect patient information at all times. We take our responsibility to protect patient information very seriously.
 
 Additionally, we have partnered with ID Experts, a leader in identity protection services with extensive experience in this field, for patient identity monitoring and protection at our expense. Through ID Experts, we have arranged for affected patients to opt for a one-year identity theft monitoring and protection membership offering, among other services:
 
 Fraud Resolution Representatives: ID Experts will provide assistance if a patient suspects that their personal information is being misused. A recovery advocate will be assigned to the case, and they will work to assess, stop, and reverse any fraudulent activity.

2018,Decatur County General Hospital,TN,HACK,Network Server,"Decatur County General Hospital in Tennessee has discovered malware has been installed on a server housing its electronic medical record system. The attacker potentially gained access to the medical records of up to 24,000 patients.
 
 An unauthorized software installation was discovered on November 27, 2017 by the hospital’s medical record system vendor, which is also responsible for maintaining the server on which the system is installed. An investigation revealed the software was a form of malware known as a cryptocurrency miner.
 
 Crytptocurrency mining is the use of computer processors to verify cryptocurrency transactions and add them to the public ledger containing details of all transactions since the currency was created. The process of verifying transactions requires computers to solve complex computational problems.
 
 Cryptocurrency mining can be performed by anyone with a computer, and in return for solving those computational problems, the miner is rewarded with a small payment for verifying the transaction.
 
 A single computer can be used to earn a few dollars a day performing cryptocurrency mining. Large numbers of computers can generate reasonable profits. An army of cryptocurrency mining slave computers, such as those infected with cryptocurrency mining malware, can generate substantial earnings. Cryptocurrency malware campaigns and infections have soared in recent months.
 
 Since cryptocurrency mining requires a considerable amount of processing power, computers infected with the malware may slow considerably, although it may not always be apparent that infection has occurred. In the case of Decatur County General Hospital, the malware infection was not identified by its EMR vendor for more than two months. The malware is believed to have been installed on or before September 22, 2017.
 
 Cryptocurrency mining malware typically only has one function. The malware is not normally associated with data theft. However, in this instance, the attacker is believed to have gained access to the server in order to install the malware. Access to patient data was therefore possible.
 
 Decatur County General Hospital conducted an in-depth investigation into the server breach and malware infection, and while no evidence of data access or data theft was uncovered, it was not possible to reasonably verify that data access had not occurred. Therefore, the decision was made to issue notifications to patients that protected health information had potentially been compromised.
 
 Due to the sensitive nature of data stored on the server – names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, diagnoses, treatment information, and insurance billing information – all patients impacted by the incident have been offered credit monitoring services for 12 months through True Identity without charge.
 
 No evidence of misuse of patient information has been reported to date and the hospital believes the sole purpose of the attacker was to install the malware, not to steal patient data. However, patients have been advised to exercise caution and monitor their accounts, credit, and EoB statements for any sign of fraudulent activity and to be wary of any communications received via the telephone, mail, or email about the incident.",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,70.0,24000.0,2400000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2016,Decatur Health Systems,KS,Theft,Paper/Films,"OBERLIN -- Decatur Health Systems employees are working with law enforcement authorities in investigating the possible theft of a binder containing the names and dates of birth of more than 700 patients who have received CAT scans since May 2012, the hospital’s chief operating officer said.
  
  Kris Mathews said the CAT scan log binder was missing from its typical location on July 25. Since then, “We have searched this place high and low,” he said.
  
  Mathews said it is thought that someone took the binder, which had been used by a radiology technician to record patient information before giving people CAT scans. The technician recorded in the binder each patient’s name, date of birth, date of exam, diagnosis leading to the CAT scan, the physician who ordered the scan and X-ray exposure levels.
  
  Mathews said the record, which did not include Social Security numbers, was kept to satisfy a requirement that X-ray exposure levels be documented for each patient. Since the theft, he said, better ways of handling the dosing log are being explored.
  
  “Our No. 1 priority is to figure out how we could keep this from happening again,” Mathews said.
  
  Theft reported to police
  
  According to a news release from the hospital, authorities think the binder was taken between 5 p.m. July 22 and 7 a.m. July 25. Mathews said doors to the area where the binder was kept were locked, but one door wasn’t latched and could have been pushed open. Hospital officials conducted an internal investigation but were unable to locate the binder.
  
  Mathews said the theft was reported to local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He said hospital administrators are cooperating with law enforcement in an effort to retrieve the binder, determine who took it and determine how the information contained within it has been used.
  
  “We’re thankful that just the names and dates of birth were included instead of other personal information,” Mathews said. “We’re hoping that the risk is very low.”
  
  Patients informed
  
  Mathews said letters were sent to the 707 people listed in the binder informing them of the privacy breach, or to relatives of deceased patients. Hospital officials were following up Thursday with phone calls.
  
  “DHS knows the importance of keeping protected health information private and sincerely apologizes to the patients whose names were in the binder,” the hospital’s news release reads.
  
  Mathews said hospital officials are working to ensure all patient information contained in other hard-copy records and in electronic files is secure. He said locks were changed within the facility, audits were conducted and new policies and procedures have been implemented. Employees also have received additional training on security.
  
  He said code numbers that make a record identifiable to a lab technician but not to a member of the public are replacing patient names in the CAT scan log.
  
  Letter recipients who have further questions were being told to call Erica Fortin, DHS privacy officer, at (785) 475-2208, ext 216.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,2.0,707.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

  DeKalb Medical said they were also doing their own internal investigation into the matter.

2014,Detroit Medical Center - Harper University Hospital,MI,Theft,Paper/Films,"A pair of thieves stole the identities of hundreds of patients at two metro Detroit hospitals and used their personal information to scam the government out of nearly $500,000 in phony tax refunds, the U.S. Attorneys office announced today.
  
  According to an indictment unsealed Monday in U.S. District Court, one of the defendants stole patient records while working at Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital and DMC Harper Hospital. She then used the patients' personal information to file false tax returns in other peoples' names, the indictment said.
  
  Charged in the scheme are Markitta Washington, 29, of Hampton, Ga., and previously of Farmington Hills; and Martez Lear, 29, of Farmington Hills, who is currently serving time in prison for gun-related crimes.
  
  The two defendants lived together in Farmington Hills when they ran their scam, records show.
  
  According to the indictment, authorities executed a search warrant at their home in January and found personal information belonging to roughly 1,400 people. The pair had a stash of bank records, credit cards, ""stacks of hospital patient records"" and hand written notes that included individuals' names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers, the indictment said. Police also found counterfeit and re-encoded credit cards and gifts cards at the home, the indictment said.
  
  The indictment alleges that at least 305 identity theft victims had false tax returns filed on their behalf for tax years 2011 and 2012, resulting in about $489,000 in false refunds. Most of the refunds were sent using prepaid debit cards, some of which were recovered from the defendants' home.
  
  ""Criminals should know that while technology has made it easier than ever for them to commit identify fraud, technology is also making it easier for law enforcement to catch them,"" U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade said. We are making enforcement of identity theft a high priority because this crime has become so pervasive and can be so damaging to victims.""
  
  Washington, who was arrested in Georgia and released on a personal bond, is expected to be in Detroit soon for an initial appearance in federal court here.
  
  Hospitals have notified individual victims whose personal information was compromised. Patients of the Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital may call 313-874-9561 with any questions. Patients of DMC Harper Hospital may call 313-966-8818.",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,30.0,1087.0,108700.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2017,Dignity Health St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center,AZ,INSD,Other,"A recent data breach incident at Dignity Health St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center has potentially put over 600 patient medical records at risk, according to a press release issued February 15 of this year.
  
  According to a routine review of employee access to the hospital’s electronic health records, St. Joseph’s found that from October 1 through November 22, 2016 a part time hospital employee viewed sections of patient medical records without authorization or appropriate reason.
  
  St. Joseph’s has since notified potentially impacted patients of the security breach through advisory letters.
  
  Potentially accessed information included patient medical records, demographic information (e.g. names and dates of birth), and clinical data, such as doctor’s orders and diagnostic information.
  
  St. Joseph’s asserts that because Social Security numbers, billing, and credit card information were not accessed during the breach, there is “no reason to believe these patients need to take any action to protect themselves against identity theft.”
  
  “Dignity Health St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center is deeply committed to protecting its patients,” the statement explained. “Any person who accesses medical records without a job-related reason is in violation of St. Joseph’s policy and appropriate action has been taken in response to this event.”",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,52.0,600.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 Last month, Dignity Health reported breaches to HHS that involved three of their hospitals in Nevada: Dignity Health St. Rose Dominican Hospitals – San Martin (1764 patients); Dignity Health St. Rose Dominican Hospitals – Siena (2078 patients), and Dignity Health St. Rose Dominican Hospitals-DeLima (2174 patients). The incident involved the hospitals providing documentation to an unnamed local contractor that they had used for years to process court-related health documents. Through a clerical error, the contract had not been renewed, so for a while, there was no contract in place although the hospitals continued to provide patient information to the contractor. The contractor handled the materials properly despite the lack of contract, and the contract renewal went through to restore the contractual relationship.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,34.0,2174.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2019,Douglas County Hospital dba Alomere Health,MN,HACK,Email,"Minnesota-based hospital operator Alomere Health this month began notifying patients of a data breach affecting 49,351 individuals, after a malicious actor gained access to two employee email accounts in late October and early November.
  
  The first incident took place between Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, 2019, while the second account hijacking happened days later on Nov. 6, the health care provider said in a security notice posted on its website.
  
  Compromised data includes names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, health insurance information and diagnosis and treatment details information. A limited subset of patients also had their Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers exposed. These patients will be offered free credit monitoring and identity protection services.
  
  Alomere said it is unclear if the offending party actually viewed any of the personally identifying data, but as a measure of caution it has mailed letters to patients whose information was left vulnerable.

2015,Duke LifePoint Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center,PA,Theft,Desktop Computer,"Conemaugh Health System’s Memorial Medical Center Reports Breach
  The west central Pennsylvania 4-hospital system announced yesterday that a number of its patients were affected by the Medical Management data breach. Conemaugh Health System’s Memorial Medical Center issued a press release confirming that some patients had been affected, and that they have been notified and offered identity theft protection for a period of one year without charge.
  
  The hospital confirmed patients from the Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, Meyersdale Medical Center and Miners Medical Center had been affected, although the number of victims was not disclosed in the initial press release.
  
  The hospital was recently acquired by the Conemaugh Health System; however on March 15, under the name Duke LifePoint Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, a breach report was submitted to OCR stating that 1,551 patients had been affected by a data breach categorized as “theft” involving a “desktop computer.” No further description was submitted along with the initial breach report – the OCR permits information to be added when it becomes available – but the report does say that no Business Associate was involved in the data breach, suggesting that this may be a separate data breach.
  
  The Medical Management data theft is being investigated by law enforcement officers. The employee could face criminal charges for stealing the data, and if convicted of taking the information for personal gain, the offense can result in up to 10 years in prison and a substantial fine.
 
 ----------
 
 Last week, we reported on a healthcare data breach where a third party facility, Medical Management LLC, connected with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) reported that approximately 2,200 UPMC patients may have had their records exposed by a Medical Management employee. That breach could be larger than originally thought, as several thousand New Jersey patients may also have had their information exposed. Moreover, Medical Management has contracts with 40 physician groups across the nation.
 
 Medical billing company data breach affecting numerous providers
 Medical Management also handled the billing for three New Jersey hospitals that have alerted patients to the possibility of their information being exposed. The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, and Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck had patient names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth transferred, according to The Record.
 
 Holy Name and Englewood Hospital told the news source that 1,500 patients at each of their hospitals received notification letters from Medical Management about the breach. The Valley Hospital did not provide a specific number, but it reportedly treats 73,000 patients in its ER per year.
 
 “We regret the inconvenience that this may have caused patients,” Valley said in a statement. “Since Medical Management LLC is not the billing company for The Valley Hospital, we sincerely apologize that we do not have further information to share with patients at this time.”

 Valley spokeswoman Maureen Curran Kleinman told the Record that all individuals who were potentially affected were notified. She added that if patients did not receive a letter, then that means they are not at risk.
 
 “We regret the inconvenience to the patients and urge patients who received the letter to take advantage of this free identity theft protection service,” Englewood spokeswoman Alicia Park told the news source.
 
 The data breach occurred when a former Medical Management employee copied certain items of personal information from the billing system over the past two years and then illegally disclosed that information to a third party.
 
 “MML takes this matter very seriously and terminated this employee after being informed of this criminal investigation,” according to a Medical Management statement. “MML is cooperating with federal law enforcement authorities in their criminal investigation.”
 
 The employee worked at Medical Management from February 2013 until March 2015, which is when the breach was discovered.
 
 Along with UPMC, Jefferson Hospital in Pennsylvania made an announcement on its website that approximately 800 individuals treated at Jefferson’s emergency department are being notified in writing that their records were possibly exposed. As with the other reported cases, compromised information includes patient names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.
 
 Pennsylvania-based Conemaugh Health System also reported on its website that it is connected with the Medical Management data breach. While it did not specify how many patients were affected, Conemaugh said it is working closely with Medical Management to ensure proper notification.
 
 “While this breach did not happen within the Conemaugh Health System and did not involve any Conemaugh employees, we regret that it has impacted our valued patients,” the statement read. “We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to do so to ensure that MML provides our patients with a swift and acceptable remedy to this unfortunate situation.”",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,758.0,0.0,155100.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2012,Duke University Health System (DUHS),NC,PHYS,Other,"The privacy and security of the Duke Medicine community and the patient information we maintain, is a top priority to Duke University Health System (“DUHS”). Regrettably, this notice concerns an incident related to certain information filed by DUHS in association with Chapter 13 bankruptcy actions.
  
  During the week of January 25, 2012, DUHS received notice that its billing subsidiary staff attached copies of outstanding billing statement(s) for services provided by DUHS facilities and/or DUHS-affiliated physicians to support proofs of claim filed in Chapter 13 bankruptcy actions by patients of DUHS. The billing statement included the patients’ name and address; patients’ and dependents’ DUHS internal medical record number, internal unique identifiers that allow Duke Medicine to link patient information across its facilities, Duke Medicine’s Interactive Voice Response (“IVR”) PIN# (when combined with other information not on the billing statements permits patient access to IVR system), patients’ health insurance carrier(s), and the last several digits of subscriber number(s); and, for each visit listed, clinical information including a short description of services received. As we continued our investigation, we then learned that in some instances, account summaries were filed with the proofs of claim and contained billing information and patients’ names, Social Security numbers, Duke internal medical records and invoice numbers, and dates of birth. These supporting documents filed by DUHS did not contain any credit card numbers or other financial information.
  
  We have no reason to believe that the information has been improperly accessed or acquired or otherwise misused in anyway. As a precaution, DUHS started mailing notification letters on March 23, 2012 and additional letters on May 18, 2012 to persons whom DUHS has confirmed were affected by this incident. We have also established a dedicated call center to assist these persons. If you believe you may have been affected by this incident but do not receive a letter by June 1, 2012, please call this toll free number 1-877-631-0440 and use reference # 3854032312. This call center is available to answer your phone calls from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm Eastern Time Monday through Friday.
  
  We have taken this incident very seriously and regret that it occurred. We have requested that the Bankruptcy Court seal the billing statements and account summaries attached to Duke Medicine’s proofs of claim. We have also revised our process to remove the billing statement and account summary from the proof of claim filings.

2016,"East Valley Community Health Center, INC",CA,HACK,Network Server,"West Covina, CA-based East Valley Community Health Center (EVCHC) has started notifying patients that some of their electronic protected health information was compromised when ransomware was installed on one of its servers.
 
 The ransomware attack occurred on October 18, 2016 and involved a ransomware variant called Troldesh/Shade. As with other forms of ransomware, Troldesh conducts scans of its local environment and encrypts a wide range of file types with an asymmetric encryption algorithm, preventing the files from being accessed.
 
 Troldesh is supplied by the ransomware author as a development kit, which allows affiliates to run their own ransomware campaigns. The ransomware is usually distributed via spam email campaigns via file attachments containing malicious JavaScript code. However, in this case, an unauthorized individual logged onto a EVCHC server and installed the ransomware.
 
 Many different files were encrypted, one of which contained the electronic health information of EVCHC patients. The file was used by EVCHC for logging claims that had been submitted to health plans. The file contained names, addresses, birthdates, medical record numbers, insurance account numbers, and health diagnosis codes. No financial information, Social Security numbers, nor Driver’s license numbers were present in any of the encrypted files.
 
 Ransomware is typically used to extract a ransom payment from the victim, not to gain access to sensitive information. However, it is possible that the attacker was able to view the ePHI contained in the file. No evidence of file access or exfiltration was discovered by EVCHC.
 
 The ransomware attack has now been reported to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights and the California Attorney General’s office. The OCR breach report indicates 65,000 individuals have been impacted.
 
 Steps have been taken to reduce the likelihood of future ransomware attacks, including the implementation of additional technical controls and the transfer of patient’ protected health information to a third party off-site server maintained by a health information technology company. EVCHC will also be conducting a full review of privacy practices and updates will be made, as appropriate, to maintain the highest level of privacy for patients.",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,52.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2018,Eastern Maine Medical Center,ME,Theft,Other,"Eastern Maine Medical Center is notifying 660 patients that some of their protected health information has been exposed. The sensitive information was stored on a portable hard drive that has gone missing from its State Street facility, in Bangor, ME.
 
 The device lacked encryption and data on the device could be accessed without the need for a password. Theft has not been confirmed, but the device could not be located during a search of its facility. The drive was last seen in its usual place on December 19, 2017 and was noticed to be missing on December 22.
 
 The device belonged to a business associate of Eastern Maine Medical Center and contained limited patient information. No Social Security numbers, financial information, or health insurance details were present on the device, only full names, birth dates, dates of service, medical record numbers, one-word condition descriptors, and procedural images.
 
 The patients impacted by the breach had visited the medical center for cardiac ablation procedures between January 3, 2011 and December 11, 2017. Not all patients who visited the medical center for those procedures were affected. Some patients had their data stored elsewhere.
 
 The potential theft has been reported to law enforcement and investigations into the circumstances surrounding the loss/theft of the hard drive are continuing. A comprehensive search of the facility was conducted although the device has now been officially declared lost and patients are now being notified of the breach by mail.
 
 The delay in issuing breach notification letters was due to the time taken to search the facility and discover which patients’ PHI was stored on the device.
 
 Even though the types of information required to commit identity theft were not exposed, all patients impacted by the incident have been offered complimentary identity theft monitoring and protection services for 12 months out of “an abundance of caution”.

 Drivers say as they approached Buford Highway on North Berkeley Lake Road, it looked like a blizzard of white paper had struck the area.
 
 ""The street was just covered in documents,"" Rod Whittle tells Channel 2's Gwinnett Bureau Chief Tony Thomas.
 
 ""You could open your door and literally just pick up documents.""
 
 Officials confirm the papers came from Eastside Medical Center in Snellville. A hospital spokeswoman tells Thomas the papers were taken by a vendor to be shredded and the investigation continues into what exactly happened.
 
 ""We take the protection of all patient privacy information very seriously. When we were made aware of this situation, we took immediate action to recover the documents. We are investigating this situation and if we find that our patient information may have been compromised we will take action immediately with the appropriate parties,"" Patti Page writes in a prepared statement.
 
 Whittle was shocked when he picked up a few pages and realized what was on them.
 
 ""Patients' names, address, phone numbers, the type of surgery they had, type of medication they were on,"" he says, ""whoever was driving had to see all these documents in the rear view mirror or side view mirror just all over the place.""
 
 And just as concerning to some is who wound up collecting all the documents.
 
 Duluth city administrators say a work crew of county inmates under the supervision of the city public works department happened to be doing their normal trash pick-up in the area when they came across the debris and began picking it up. Officials say there is no indication any of them did anything illegal with the documents. The paperwork was placed in garbage bags and given to the Duluth Police.
 
 
 Even the inmate trustees seemed surprised what they found in front of them. One could be heard saying, ""Who is this lacking responsibility? Peoples' IDs, ID copies, fax copies!""

 Officials said the data -- 975 patient names and some medical record numbers, dates of service, names of insurance provider/referring provider and type of treatment received -- are so generic that they are unlikely to lead to identity theft.
 
 Moreover, officials said there is no indication that anyone has accessed the information, which was on a flash drive lost by an employee.
 
 “We regret this incident occurred and any inconvenience or concern this may cause to some of our patients,” hospital officials said in a statement released Friday.
 
 According to hospital officials, this is what happened:
 
 An employee from the Cuyahoga Falls rehab center was at an all-day business meeting Feb. 19 somewhere off hospital grounds and carried along a flash drive with the information.
 
 The employee, who officials declined to name or identify by job, realized Feb. 24 the flash drive was missing. The employee immediately reported what happened to hospital officials and said the flash drive must have been inside a zippered day planner left behind at the meeting.
 
 Neither the day planner, nor the flash drive was ever found.
 
 Officials said the device did not contain credit card, debit card, Social Security or bank account numbers; nor did it include patient addresses, dates of birth or phone numbers.
 
 
 The employee has since been disciplined and all employees of Cleveland Clinic Akron General will be re-trained about how to protect patient information, said Stephanie York, hospital spokeswoman.
 
 York said it took weeks to notify patients because the hospital first had to track down patients who had changed addresses over the past five or six years, or who had died.

 The computer was password protected but not encrypted. It contained an electronic index with limited patient information used by EMC. The information in the index file included, patient names, ages, dates of birth, the last four digits of the Social Security numbers and the hospital's Medical Record Numbers (MRNs).
 
 The computer did not contain any information regarding the patients' medical conditions or treatments at EMC or any other medical records. Additionally, there was no financial, bank, credit card or health insurance information on the computer. The information related only to EMC and not to any other healthcare providers on the campus.
 
 The theft occurred at about 6 p.m. Friday, March 11, 2011 and EMC staff discovered a television missing shortly afterward. But the computer was not found to be missing until EMC personnel reported for work on Monday, March 14, 2011. At this time, EMC has no reason to believe that the computer was stolen for the information that it contained.
 
 The theft has been reported to law enforcement, and EMC has been cooperating with the investigation. Notification letters are being mailed to all affected patients beginning today.
 
 EMC has provided high quality, compassionate care for nearly 40 years. The safeguarding of our patients' information is a top priority. We immediately took steps to ensure the safety of patient information. EMC's safeguard requirements and policies and procedures for computers were reviewed, and patient index data was moved from individual computers to our secure data center. To the extent that the data may be needed outside of the secure data center, it will be encrypted and returned to the data center when it is no longer needed. We have also taken steps to further secure our facilities during off-hours.
 
 EMC deeply regrets that this happened and assures its patients and families of its patients, that it has taken immediate steps to investigate and attempt to recover the computer. We are committed to fully protecting all of the information entrusted to us by patients and their families. A call center has been established to answer any questions that the affected patients might have and the toll-free number is being provided in the notification letters that are being mailed.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,3.0,514330.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

 Elliot Hospital and Manchester police are investigating the theft of four computers containing limited personal information about patients.

 Hospital officials said the PCs were stolen from an employee’s car in March. The employee was transporting the PCs to a location where they could be destroyed.
 
 Hospital officials believe the information on the hard drives would not be useful to identity thieves.
 
 However, the hospital is notifying patients affected by the theft.
 
 The hospital takes a data snapshot of every PC before junking it. It was able to look back and see what was on the hard drives.
 
 “And we saw that there was a small handful of archive of documents that had been archived on the PCs’ local drive containing fairly limited information relating to 1,213 patients,” said John Friberg, senior vice president of Elliot Hospital.
 
 The computers had auto-archived three spreadsheets and 20 emails. The documents included very basic information about patients, such as their names, dates of service and various billing codes.
 
 “it’s very important to keep in mind or to understand that this is not a situation involving the breach of electronic medical records,” Friberg said. “In fact, none of the information involved any medical records. For instance, nothing on these four PCs related to any medical history of any patients.”
 
 The hospital has since made changes to ensure its computers no longer auto-archive this information. Officials believe the information is unlikely to be of any value to possible identity thieves. However, they understand patients will be upset.
 
 “We do realize at Elliot that these sorts of issues can be very concerning and confusing for people, and we certainly do empathize with that concern,” Friberg said.
 
 Elliot Hospital is sending out letters to the patients affected and setting up a toll-free number to help answer questions.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2019,Emerson Hospital,MA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"Emerson Hospital in Concord, MA, is alerting 6,314 patients that some of their protected health information has been exposed due to a security breach at a third-party vendor in May 2018.
 
 The hospital explained that the breach occurred between May 9 and May 17, 2018 and was an unauthorized disclosure incident. A former employee of MiraMed Global Services, a company that helps the hospital collect payments, was discovered to have sent files containing protected health information to a third-party who was not authorized to receive the information.
 
 The files contained the types of information usually sought by identity thieves, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and insurance policy information. Financial information and health information were not compromised.
 
 The employee responsible was fired over the breach and the matter was reported to law enforcement. It is unclear whether the employee responsible has been charged over the theft.
 
 A forensic investigation confirmed that ePHI had been stolen, but a spokesperson for the hospital issued a statement saying, “A detailed forensic investigation showed that the files were of such poor quality that a third-party did not find the data useful.”
 
 Even though the information does not appear to have been misused, as a precaution, all affected patients have been offered identity theft protection services through Experian IdentityWorks for 24 months without charge.
 
 This is the second healthcare institution to report that it has been affected by the breach. Rush System for Health also reported a similar case to OCR on February 28, 2019. Even though names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, and insurance information was also compromised, Rush reported that patients faced a low-risk of fraud since no financial information was compromised. Approximately 45,000 of its patients were affected.

 The IRS discovered the theft and notified Emory when patients' names, Social Security numbers and possibly other identifying information were used to file fraudulent income tax returns. Emory said the patients' addresses, dates of birth and limited health information such as the medical record number also might have been taken.
 
 Emory spokesman Jeffry Molter said medical records were not compromised.
 
 ""It was a theft of information,"" Molter said. ""This theft was not a breach into the electronic medical records at Emory Healthcare.""
 
 The 77 people identified by the IRS were patients at the Emory Clinic section of Orthopaedics at Emory Healthcare, according to Molter. They were told to place fraud alerts on their credit reports.
 
 Emory is also notifying and extending the same identity theft protection to approximately 2,400 additional patients of The Emory Clinic section of the Orthopaedics department who were not believed to be affected by this incident. The others were sent letters Monday and offered protection just in case some of their information is used fraudulently.

2012,Emory Healthcare,GA,Other,Other,"Emory Healthcare says 10 backup disks containing data on 315,000 patients are missing from a hospital storage facility. The 10 disks held data on surgical patients treated between September 1990 and April 2007.
 
 Download the authoritative guide:
 
 Emory Healthcare in Atlanta says that it has misplaced 10 backup disks containing information for 315,000 patients.
 
 The health system provides clinical care as part of the Robert W. Woodruff Health Sciences Center of Emory University.
 
 Emory announced the data breach on April 18. The health system didn't immediately respond to eWEEK's request for comment.
 
 The 10 disks held data on surgical patients treated between September 1990 and April 2007, the health system reported. The disks are missing from a storage location at Emory University Hospital.
 
 The locations where affected patients were treated include Emory University Hospital Midtown and the Emory Clinic Ambulatory Surgery Center.
 
 Of the 315,000 patient files on the disks, 228,000 included Social Security numbers. Other information at risk included patient names, dates of surgery, diagnoses and procedure codes. Names of surgeons and anesthesiologists that the patients had seen were also included in the records.
 
 The disks contained old data from software Emory deactivated in 2007. The hospital's IT systems were not hacked into, the health system stressed.
 
 ""We sincerely regret this incident and want to assure our patients that we are committed to safeguarding their personal information,"" John T. Fox, president and CEO of Emory Healthcare, said in a statement. ""While we have no evidence at this time that any personal information has been misused as a result of this incident, we want to take all precautions to ensure our patients' information is safe.""
 
 Fox's own data may have been included on the disks, since he had surgery at the hospital during the period the data covers, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
 
 Emory stored the unencrypted disks in an unlocked cabinet, although the office was locked at night, Fox said at an April 18 press conference, according to the Journal-Constitution.
 
 Although the disks contained data for outdated software no longer in use, those companies that do use outdated systems or firewalls are more at risk of a data breach, experts say.
 
 The disks disappeared between Feb. 7 and Feb. 20, according to Emory, and the health system informed patients beginning April 17.
 
 ""We have taken immediate steps to fortify the protective measures that are already in place,"" Emory wrote in its letter to patients. ""New and enhanced data control measures have been implemented accordingly.""
 
 Emory didn't specify which data control measures have been implemented, however.
 
 The hospital system has set up a Website and a hotline (855-205-6950) for patients to inquire about the breach. It will also provide patients with identity protection through IT security provider Kroll.
 
 In an April 11 report, Kroll and HIMSS Analytics suggested that health care organizations need to step up in forming policies regarding patient data security. Methods to tighten security include stricter hiring practices, more background checks and minimizing data access, said Lisa Gallagher, senior director of privacy and security for HIMSS.

2017,Emory Healthcare,GA,HACK,Other,"Emory Healthcare has been hit with a cyberattack that compromised the records of some 80,000 patients who used an online appointment system.
 
 The Atlanta-based health system's ""waits and delays"" appointments system was hacked sometime around the turn of the new year, Emory announced earlier this week. After removing the appointments database, the hackers demanded a ransom to restore the site. Emory Healthcare did not say whether it paid the ransom.
 
 The breach affected 79,930 patients of Emory Clinic's Orthopaedics and Spine Center and Brain Health Center. The six-hospital system said the breached database did not include financial information and social security numbers. However, it did expose names, birth dates, contact information, internal medical record numbers and appointment information.
 
 Emory learned about the breach on Jan. 3, and said it is ""reviewing and refining"" its security measures for internal and third-party computer systems.
 
 Around the same time, Emory Healthcare discovered an unnamed security research center also breached the database. The firm looks for security weaknesses, according to Emory.
 
 Security research center MacKeeper has said in a blog post that it uncovered a poorly configured patient record database that seemed to belong to Emory Brain Health Center.
 
 So far this year, 325,558 patients' data have been breached, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service Office for Civil Rights' Breach Portal, which displays breaches of health data that affect 500 or more people.
 
 Most of the exposed data were from healthcare providers, and Emory's hack is the largest single incident reported in 2017.
 
 The healthcare system sent mailed alerts to the affected patients, who were people who had appointments between March 25, 2015, and January 3, 2017, at the Orthopaedics and Spine Center and between December, 6, 2016, and January 3, 2017, at the Brain Health Center.

2012,"Emory University Hospital, Emory Healthcare",GA,PORT,Other,"1. 
 Emory Healthcare has determined that 10 backup discs containing information on surgical patients treated between September 1990 and April 2007 are missing from a storage location at Emory University Hospital. As soon as it was discovered that the discs were missing, an extensive search and investigation was initiated and is continuing. It is important to note that there was no actual or attempted breach or ""hacking in"" of Emory's electronic medical records or other systems. 
 
 The information contained on the discs is related to approximately 315,000 surgical patients treated at Emory University Hospital, Emory University Hospital Midtown (formerly known as Emory Crawford Long Hospital) and The Emory Clinic Ambulatory Surgery Center. The information did not relate to patients at other Emory Healthcare facilities or to patients treated after April 2007. 
 
 All affected patients, at Emory Healthcare's cost, will be provided access to identity protection services, including credit monitoring, through Kroll, Inc., a company specializing in such services. 
 
 Approximately 228,000 of the patient records included Social Security numbers; another approximately 87,000 records did not include Social Security numbers. The discs contained certain protected health information, including the patient names, dates of surgery, diagnoses, procedure codes or the name of the surgical procedures, device implant information, surgeon names and anesthesiologist names. 
 
 ""We sincerely regret this incident and want to assure our patients that we are committed to safeguarding their personal information,"" said John T. Fox, president and CEO of Emory Healthcare. ""While we have no evidence at this time that any personal information has been misused as a result of this incident, we want to take all precautions to ensure our patients' information is safe. We are moving forward expeditiously with providing all affected patients, at our cost, access to identity protection services, including credit monitoring."" 
 
 The investigation has determined that the discs were removed sometime between February 7, 2012, and February 20, 2012. They contained data files from an obsolete software system that was deactivated in 2007. This deactivated system was accessed very infrequently and only as requested by either patients or their physicians. The last time data were accessed was in 2010. 
 
 Patients are being informed through personal letters mailed to their homes beginning April 17. The letter provides details on what has occurred, actions taken to locate the discs and steps patients can take now to protect themselves against possible identity theft, as well as information on placing a fraud alert on their credit file. Emory Healthcare is recommending that individuals regularly review their credit reports for anything they do not recognize, and to consider using the other services Emory is providing, as specified in the letter. For more information on steps patients can take to avoid potential problems, view Emory Healthcare's ""Notice to Our Patients"" at www.emoryhealthcare.org/protection.
 
 Emory Healthcare has launched an institution-wide initiative to reinforce and clarify existing policies and procedures for safeguarding the security and privacy of sensitive information. In addition, Emory is conducting a comprehensive inventory of all physical spaces across the system to ensure data are properly secured.

 *In Emory's case, the disks were kept in an employee's office cabinet in a hallway with restricted access, reported WSBTV2 . The employee did not properly secure the disks but will not face disciplinary action, the station reorted. Since the disks were not labeled “patient information,” few people would know what they contained, Fox said in the article.

 *On September 18, 2018 Episcopal Health Services became aware of suspicious activity in employee email accounts. We immediately began an investigation to determine what happened and what information may have been affected. With the assistance of third-party forensic investigators, we determined that certain employee email accounts were subject to unauthorized access between August 28, 2018 and October 5, 2018. These email accounts were then reviewed to determine whether they contained any protected health or personal information. On November 1, 2018, Episcopal Health Services determined that the accounts subject to unauthorized access contained protected health information of certain individuals. Episcopal Health Services is not aware of any reported attempted or actual misuse of any personal information as a result of this event. The types of information contained within the potentially impacted emails are: Social Security number, date of birth, financial account information, medical history information, prescription information, medical record number, treatment or diagnosis information, and health insurance information or policy number. The types of information varied by individual.
 
 On November 15, 2018, Episcopal Health Services began mailing notice letters to individuals whose information was contained within the impacted accounts and for whom they had a postal address. Episcopal Health Services continued reviewing the contents of the impacted email accounts to determine whether they contained any protected information. On February 26, 2019, Episcopal Health Services determined that the additional accounts subject to unauthorized access contained protected information of certain individuals. However, the list of potentially affected individuals provided by the vendor did not include addresses for a large number of individuals and included many potential duplicates. Therefore, Episcopal Health Services was required to review its records to attempt to locate the missing addresses and remove potential duplicates. This process was completed on March 19, 2019. As a result of this continued review, Episcopal Health Services mailed a second round of notice letters to additional individuals whose information was determined to be contained within the impacted email accounts and for whom they had a postal address. Episcopal Health Services has offered potentially impacted individuals access to credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for one year without charge.
 
 Episcopal Health Services encourages potentially impacted individuals to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review account statements, and to monitor their credit reports and explanation of benefits forms for suspicious activity. Episcopal Health Services is providing potentially impacted individuals with contact information for the three major credit reporting agencies, as well as providing advice on how to obtain free credit reports and how to place fraud alerts and security freezes on their credit files. Pursuant to federal law, you cannot be charged to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report.
 
 Potentially impacted individuals may also find information regarding identity theft, fraud alerts, security freezes and the steps they may take to protect their information by contacting the credit bureaus, the Federal Trade Commission or their state Attorney General. The Federal Trade Commission can be reached at: 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580; www.identitytheft.gov; 1-877-ID-THEFT (1-877-438-4338); and TTY: 1-866-653-4261.

""We did our own investigation of the incident,"" Erlanger officials said. ""We needed to determine who was affected and who was not affected and what was on database. Within 24 hours of determining what the database was, we got the letters out.""
 
 According to the letters, sent Friday afternoon to about 4,150 current and former employees thought to be affected and about 2,050 current employees who were not, the names and accompanying personal information were stored on a USB storage device, also known as a ""jump drive."" The database information was limited to names and Social Security numbers, Erlanger officials said. Those people affected include anyone who went through what hospital administrators described as ""status changes,"" such as hiring, termination, retirement or resignation, or changing titles or departments between November 2003 and September 2006.
 
 Erlanger officials said an employee who was authorized to use the information was working with the data in a ""secured area,"" and noticed on Sept. 15 that the device was missing. It remains unclear whether the information was lost, misplaced, or was stolen. Erlanger officials said there was no sign of a break-in to the office where the employee was working.
 
 ""This guy was working on it ... it was on his desk, and then it was gone,"" Erlanger board Chairman Bob Johnson said. He said he thinks the storage device was thrown away accidentally. ""It should take care of itself,"" he said. ""I don't think it was one of those situations where somebody was trying to steal identities."" He said his understanding was that the employee who had been working on the information told supervisors right away when he realized the device was missing.
 
 Erlanger spokeswoman Nancy White said she could not identify the person or say whether the employee was disciplined in any way.
 ""This issue has allowed us to thoroughly examine every aspect of our information security program and implement ongoing safeguards immediately to ensure that this does not happen again,"" CEO Jim Brexler wrote in the letter sent to employees.

The individual was required to access patients’ protected health information (PHI) for legitimate work reasons, yet data access rights were abused.
 
 The employee worked in the Atmore Community Hospital: A 49-bed facility serving patients in Escambia and Monroe counties in Alabama. A routine audit of PHI access logs on November 18, 2016 revealed that the individual first started inappropriately accessing patient records from October 3, 2015. Records continued to be inappropriately accessed until November 11, 2016.
 
 According to a press release issued by Infirmary Health, the information accessed was limited to patient names, admission dates and flowsheets. It is unclear why the information was accessed, although it is not believed that any data have been disclosed to any other individual nor copied and removed from the hospital. PHI appears to have been accessed purely out of curiosity.
 
 In accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Rules, the employee was authorized to view the minimum necessary information to conduct work duties and had received extensive training and specific instructions not to access the PHI of patients for non-work related reasons.
 
 As a result of the discovery, the employee was placed on leave until the matter was investigated, and was later fired for breaching hospital policies and HIPAA Rules.
 
 Infirmary Health has informed affected patients by mail and advised them to monitor their personal financial activity as a precaution, although the risk of any information being used inappropriately is believed to be very low.
 
 Training must be provided to healthcare employees on HIPAA Rules covering patient privacy, the circumstances under which PHI can be accessed, and the penalties for improper access.
 
 Healthcare organizations should be aware that even with extensive training, unauthorized PHI access is likely to occur. In this case, patient privacy has been violated but no financial harm is believed to have been caused. However, as we have seen on numerous occasions this year, that is not always the case.

2016,Fairbanks Hospital,IN,Unauthorized Disclosure,Network Server,"1. Fairbanks Hospital in Indianapolis is notifying an undisclosed number of patients that employees could have been accessing protected health information of patients since at least November 2013 (and possibly earlier). The information that was accessed included current and former patients’ social security numbers, contact information, diagnosis, treatment and health insurance.
 
 In a notification dated December 16, the hospital writes that they are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of any protected health information.
 
 Of concern, it appears that their investigators were not able to determine whether any employee actually accessed any patient’s record inappropriately. So it may well be that some employees snooped on records, and yet, the hospital would not have been able to detect that. And if it couldn’t detect whether the employees were accessing PHI records inappropriately, it sounds like they might have to notify every patient seen at the hospital since November 2013. DataBreaches.net has sent an inquiry to Fairbanks via their site contact form and will update this post as more information becomes available.
 
 From their notification:
 December 16, 2016
 
 To Our Valued Patients,
 
 Fairbanks Hospital recently discovered an event that may affect the security of certain current and former patients’ protected health information. While we are unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of any protected health information, we are providing potentially impacted patients with information about the event, steps taken since discovering the incident, and what they can do to better protect against identity theft and fraud, should they feel it is appropriate to do so.
 
 What Happened? On October 18, 2016, Fairbanks became aware that some files on our internal network that contained patient information were electronically accessible to Fairbanks employees, including employees who were not intended to have access to patient information. Fairbanks hired an outside computer forensics expert to determine the nature and scope of this issue. The investigation has determined that this issue existed since at least November of 2013, however we are unable to determine whether the issue existed prior to that time. We have now corrected this issue so that only the appropriate Fairbanks personnel has electronic access to files containing patient information.
 
 The patient information impacted by this issue was only accessible to Fairbanks employees. Because we have not been able to confirm whether this issue ever resulted in inappropriate access to patient information by a Fairbanks employee, we are providing notice of this incident to all potentially affected individuals in an abundance of caution.
 
 What Information Was Involved? Based upon our investigation, it was determined that the following types of patient information were contained on one or more files on our network that were impacted by this issue: name, Social Security number, date of birth, contact information, patient identification number, diagnosis, treatment information, health insurance information, and information relating to initial admission and scheduling of appointments. The types of information impacted were different depending on the individual patient, with the majority of affected patients only having their name and limited information relating to initial admission and scheduling of appointments impacted. Fairbanks is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of patient information as a result of this incident.
 
 What Are We Doing? Fairbanks takes the security of our patients’ information very seriously. We have taken steps to ensure only the appropriate Fairbanks personnel has access to patient information. We are mailing written notice of this incident to all potentially impacted individuals for whom we have contact information, along with the same information that is contained below, entitled Steps You Can Take to Protect Against Identity Theft and Fraud. We are also reporting this incident to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and news media outlets servicing the state of Indiana.

2011,Fairview Health Services,MN,Loss,Paper/Films,"Fairview Health Services said that it has misplaced approximately 1,200 patient records during a move to a new office-and notices went out Tuesday to those affected. On Saturday, February 19, employees of Fairview Health Services-the system under which several local hospitals operate-packed and secured a box of printed reports listing health and billing information for patients who were admitted to Fairview Southdale Hospital between April 2010 and February 2011.
 
 The records were supposed to go to a new office just a few miles away from the Minneapolis office where the records were last seen. But on Monday, February 21, Fairview staffers couldn't locate the box. ""Fairview personnel believe the box arrived in the new secure location but are unable to confirm this,"" the health system said in a statement. Under federal law, the system has 60 days to notify patients about a security breach involving their records. Consequently, notification letters were sent out Tuesday to all affected patients.
 
 The missing reports were used to facilitate insurance coverage and claims processing. They include patient names, birth dates, admission dates, insurance company group and member identification numbers, medical diagnoses and procedures, and physician information. ""To date, there has been no evidence that any information has been accessed or misused,"" according to Fairview. The reports do not include patient Social Security numbers or any financial information.
 
 Fairview said that its attempts to find the missing records included comprehensive searches of sending and receiving areas and interviews with both employees and vendors. Fairview is offering all affected patients a free 12-month subscription to an identity protection service. The service will cost Fairview $31 for each person who signs up-or a maximum of $37,200.
 
 ""Fairview takes this incident very seriously,"" the health system said in its statement. ""We are committed to ensuring the privacy and security of our patients' health information. We will continue to investigate this incident, review our processes and make improvements where appropriate.""
 
 Fairview said that it will notify patients ""as soon as possible"" if the misplaced records are located.

Welch pleaded before United States District Judge William K. Sessions III in Burlington.
 
 According to statements made in court, the crime arose from conduct in 2008, when Welch was a physician with Fletcher Allen Health Care. On account of that position, Welch had access to the electronic medical records of Fletcher Allen patients. At the hearing Welch admitted to obtaining the private medical information of a woman who was not his patient and with whom he was in a sexual relationship. Welch admitted that his purpose in pursuing this information was to ascertain whether the woman carried a sexually transmitted disease. The government also stated that Welch had admitted to accessing the records of other women who were not his patients.
 
 The Court has scheduled sentencing for March 26. Following the plea, the Court released Welch on his own recognizance. Welch faces a maximum sentence of up to one year in prison and a $50,000 fine.

2011,Florida Hospital,FL,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"Florida Hospital tried to reassure patients Friday that a breach of its electronic medical records spanning 20 months was limited to certain patients and not used for identity theft.
 
 Instead, the intent of the breach — which targeted emergency-room patients who were involved in motor-vehicle accidents — appears to have been to pass the information on to an attorney-referral service. However, neither the hospital nor the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, which continues to investigate the incident, could confirm the motive.
 
 The problem came to the hospital's attention, according to hospital spokeswoman Samantha O'Lenick, when a woman who had been in a car accident complained that she had been contacted by a lawyer referral service — and there apparently was no other way for the service to have obtained her personal information.
 
 The breach occurred between January 2010 and Aug. 15, 2011, O'Lenick said. All 2,252 patients whose records were subject to ""inappropriate access"" are being contacted by mail.
 
 The hospital has fired the three employees involved, all of whom were nonmedical personnel whose records indicated no previous disciplinary actions. On Sept. 6 the matter was referred to both the Osceola County Sheriff's Office and the FBI. The hospital did not further publicize the situation until Friday, when it took out a public notice to alert patients who might overlook the news in their mailbox.
 
 ""Certainly we do criminal background checks [when people are hired],"" said O'Lenick, who would not release the names of the employees because of the ongoing investigation. ""But I think what's more important is to lock the system down so [nonessential] employees don't have access to that information. I think it can be enticing at times for people.""
 
 O'Lenick said the hospital already has restricted such access.
 
 Taking precautions
 
 The original breach occurred at the company's hospital in Celebration, although the employees involved had access to patient files in Osceola, Orange and Seminole counties.
 
 ""We deeply regret that this happened,"" O'Lenick added. ""And we want to assure our patients and the community that we're taking it super-seriously, and we're providing all kinds of support services to demonstrate to them that we take that very seriously.""
 
 Despite the lack of evidence that identity theft was the motive, the hospital has established a help line — 1-855-366-0141 — for victims to call to set up free identity-theft prevention, credit monitoring and any credit restoration that might be needed.
 
 O'Lenick called the move ""an abundance of caution"" because the perpetrators had access to the patients' names, dates of birth, social security numbers and insurance information — everything that would be needed to steal a person's identity.
 
 While no arrests have yet been made, Osceola sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain said the three employees could face third-degree felony charges under Florida law if they passed along the information to an outside party. An investigator with the sheriff's economic crimes unit is working with the hospital's corporate data security officials to pursue the case.
 
 Data security was able to identify the employees by tracking access codes and tracing the pages viewed.
 
 Digital trail
 
 As the federal government pushes to move more medical records online, the breach is likely to make some patients nervous.
 
 ""There are employees within the hospital who will have access to these records, and ultimately it just comes down to whether they as individuals are ethical or not,"" said Larry Enders, 42, of Kissimmee. He was treated three years ago at Florida Hospital Orlando's emergency room and said he was hit 10 days later by a fraudulent charge on the same credit card he had used to pay his medical bill.
 
 ""I always wondered, because that's the only time my card was out of my sight,"" Enders said. ""But there's not much you can do about it.
 
 ""If you're in an emergency room, you're sort of stuck.""
 
 But experts in the field of electronic record-keeping said such files are actually safer in some ways than the old-fashioned kind.
 
 ""This intentional breach could have happened on a paper record as well,"" said Karen van Caulil, executive director of the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine Regional Extension Center. The center is working with healthcare providers across Central Florida to help them develop and use electronic records systems.
 
 ""The good news is that with the electronic system there is a data footprint,"" van Caulil said, ""and Florida Hospital was able to immediately determine which employees accessed the information on which specific patients.""
 
 Further, she said, hospital officials were able to gather enough evidence to terminate the employees and contact the patients.
 
 ""With a paper record system, these same unethical employees could have made photocopies of the information or handwritten the information off the paper chart,"" van Caulil said. ""And no one would have been able to prove they did anything wrong or know the scope or extent of their wrongdoing.""",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,59.0,2252.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

 Hospital campuses in Orange, Osceola and Seminole Counties are affected.
 
 There is no evidence that the patients' information have been misused, but the hospital is offering identity theft protection to them via a letter with instructions.
 
 The two employees have been terminated, the hospital said.
 
 ""This incident should not be a reflection of the collective workforce at Florida Hospital, who work tirelessly to provide the highest quality of care and protect patients' rights,"" said Florida Hospital spokeswoman Samantha Kearns O'Lenick in a statement.
 
 Law enforcement officials notified the hospital of the activity in May 2, 2014, after discovering the records during a separate investigation.
 
 It was then determined that the two employees printed patient ""face sheets"" – the summary that may include a patient's name, address, Social Security number, phone number, health insurance information and physician names and diagnosis – outside of their normal job duties.
 
 Hospital officials said that they couldn't notify the patients until today because it could have impeded law enforcement's investigation.
 
 Florida Hospital officials did not say whether the two employees face criminal charges.

2012,"Florida Hospital Tampa (formerly University Community Hospital Medical Center), Crothall Healthcare, Naval Medical Center (Bob Wilson Naval Hospital)",FL,INSD,Other,"TAMPA — Someone used personal information stolen from emergency room patients at Florida Hospital Tampa to commit tax fraud, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday.
 
 Two local women and a San Diego man were arrested Thursday on federal fraud charges.
 
 Tanya Cullens of Brandon worked for Crothall Healthcare, a contractor responsible for maintenance at the hospital, when a list of ER patients' names, Social Security numbers and other information was stolen in January, the complaint said.
 
 Cullens is accused of giving the list to a 10-year veteran tax return preparer, who in turn filed fraudulent tax returns using the patients' names without their permission.
 
 Florida Hospital, formerly called University Community Hospital, released a statement that said in part: ""We recently learned that personal information relating to 45 of our patients had been compromised in January 2012. These patients have been notified and we are fully cooperating with investigating agencies. We deeply regret that this incident occurred.""
 
 The complaint said Cullens was a part of a ring that included Carlista Hawls of Riverview and Kenyon Williams of San Diego. Along with the unnamed preparer, the group is accused of filing 225 fake tax returns, requesting $1.56 million in refunds in 2012. The IRS processed about $550,000 of the fake refunds, documents show.
 
 The preparer told investigators that Hawls filed false returns and flew with her to San Diego to train Kenyon Williams. While there, Williams gave them more names to use, the complaint said.
 
 One list had come from a naval hospital in San Diego, but the preparer refused to use it because her son was in the military, she told authorities.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,318.0,45.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1500000.0,0.0
2014,Flowers Hospital,AL,Theft,Paper/Films,"A former Alabama hospital worker has been sentenced to serve two years in prison for his role in an identity theft case that led to federal tax refund fraud. The case also has resulted in a class action lawsuit.
 The breach at 235-bed Flowers Hospital in Dothan, Ala., spotlights that ""insider threats are a large challenge,"" says privacy attorney Adam Greene, of law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, who is not involved in the case. ""Policies, procedures and training can influence good employees, but may have little impact on employees who are considering using information for criminal purposes,"" he says.
 
 ""Some good ways to reduce the risk include thorough background checks of employees, reducing the use of Social Security numbers and other risky information within the organization where possible, minimizing the types of employees who have access to such information, reviewing system activity to identify patterns that may demonstrate abuse of access, and considering technologies such as data loss prevention to reduce the risk of information leaving the network,"" the attorney adds.
 
 But Greene notes that even with all the right controls in place, ""it is virtually impossible to completely eliminate the threat of insiders abusing their access to information systems.""
 
 The U.S. Department of Justice, in a Dec. 12 statement, said that in addition to his prison sentence, former hospital lab technician, Kamarian D. Millender was also ordered to pay about $19,000 in restitution after pleading guilty in July to one count of aggravated identity theft.
 
 Flowers Hospital, where Millender formerly worked, is part of the Community Health Systems chain. But the breach involving Millender was unrelated to a larger hacker attack on Community Health Systems earlier this year that affected 4.5 million patients.
 
 The Alabama hospital incident is listed on the Department of Health and Human Services' ""wall of shame"" list of major breaches as a theft of paper records occurring from June 2013 to February 2014 and affecting 629 individuals.
 
 In the criminal case against Millender, federal prosecutors say he and others stole patient medical records that contained personal identification information, which was then used to file more than 100 false tax returns, victimizing approximately 73 individuals. Prosecutors say the false tax returns attempted to defraud an estimated $536,000 from the IRS. However, ""the IRS was able to stop the vast majority of the falsely claimed refunds, but approximately $18,915 in refunds were issued,"" according to the prosecutors' statement.
 
 Meanwhile, the class action lawsuit filed against Flowers Hospital in May alleges that the breach affected ""thousands"" of plaintiffs.
 
 ""Flowers [Hospital] flagrantly disregarded plaintiffs' ... privacy rights by intentionally, willfully, recklessly and/or negligently failing to take the necessary precautions required to safeguard and protect their PII/PHI from unauthorized disclosure,"" the suit alleges. The suit claims the plaintiffs' personal information ""was improperly handled and stored, and was otherwise not kept in accordance with applicable and appropriate security protocols, policies and procedures,"" which led to the theft.
 
 The class action suit alleges that patient information affected by the breach includes names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, treating physician and/or departments for each individual, medical diagnoses, medical record numbers, medical service codes, and health insurance information.
 
 ""There is a high likelihood that significant identity theft and/or identity fraud has not yet been discovered or reported and a high probability that criminals who may now possess plaintiffs' PII and PHI, but will do so later, or re-sell it,"" the lawsuit states. It alleges the hospital violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act and contains allegations of negligence and invasion of privacy by public disclosure of private facts. It seeks unspecified damages as well as reimbursement for legal expenses.
 
 A Flowers Hospital spokeswoman declined to comment on the criminal case involving the former lab worker or the class action lawsuit.
 
 An attorney representing the plaintiffs in the class action suit against Flowers did not reply to Information Security Media Group's request for comment. Federal prosecutors involved with the Millender criminal case also did not respond to ISMG's request for comment.
 
 Privacy and information security expert Rebecca Herold points out that a big hurdle with preventing insider breaches is that, ""many organizations don't want to accept that their employees would ever take information from patients or insureds and commit a crime with them, especially within healthcare provider settings, where the focus is on patient health and well-being.""
 
 Because of that trust, ""organizations often do not have the policies, processes, training, awareness reminders, oversight and auditing in place to verify that employees truly are doing the right things and have not wandered off the path of compliance onto the criminal highway,"" says Herold, a co-owner of the consulting firm HIPAA Compliance Tools and CEO of The Privacy Professor.
 
 While potential insider breaches will always pose a challenge for many healthcare related organizations, there is one key piece of advice that can go a long way in preventing these incidents, Herold says.
 
 ""It always starts from the top: there must be strong support for information security and privacy initiatives from the organization's top leader,"" she says. ""Make sure all employees know that top management expects them to work in a legal and ethical manner, and that those violating the corporate policies, and applicable laws, will face appropriate sanctions, including the potential for termination and for legal actions and jail time.""",1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,60.0,629.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

HORNE is providing this notice on behalf of Forrest General Hospital.
 
 What Happened? On November 1, 2017, HORNE discovered that the email account of one of its employees was sending phishing emails. HORNE immediately launched an internal investigation and determined that the employee was the victim of a phishing attack and that the email account had been subject to unauthorized access from October 31, 2017 to November 1, 2017. HORNE continued to investigate, with the assistance of a third party forensic investigator, to understand the nature and scope of the event, and whether any sensitive data was at risk. On November 20, 2017, the third party forensic investigator confirmed that certain emails within the employee’s email account were subject to unauthorized access. HORNE reviewed the emails to determine if any sensitive data was contained therein, and on November 27, 2017, HORNE confirmed that certain of the emails contained an attachment with protected health information of certain patients of Forrest General Hospital.
 
 What Information Was Involved? The data elements located within the attachment included some combination of the patients’ name, Medicaid identification number, date of birth, patient account number, dates of service and Social Security number. HORNE cannot confirm whether the unauthorized individual accessed or acquired the attachment, but because it cannot confirm this fact, HORNE is providing notice to the potentially affected patients.
 
 What We Are Doing. The confidentiality, privacy, and security of its clients’ patient information is one of HORNE’s highest priorities. HORNE has stringent security measures in place to protect the security of information in its possession. In addition, as part of its ongoing commitment to the security of protected health information in its care, HORNE is working to implement additional safeguards and security measures to enhance the privacy and security of information on its systems. Forrest General Hospital will report this incident to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Officials at Froedtert Health, a three-hospital health system based in Milwaukee, Wis., notified patients of a data breach Wednesday after a computer virus may have compromised the personal health information of some 43,000 people. Patients seen at the health system's Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee; Community Memorial Hospital in Menomonee Falls; St. Joseph’s Hospital in West Bend; and Froedtert Health Medical Group were mailed notification letters the week of February 11. According to a Froedtert Health statement, officials learned Dec. 14 that the virus may have allowed hackers into an employee's work computer. A computer forensics company was unable to ""definitively rule out the possibility the virus was able to obtain information stored in the employee's work computer account,"" the statement reads. The employee's work computer contained patient names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, medical record numbers, health insurance information and clinical data and Social Security numbers in some cases. 
Froedtert Health runs a 3-hospital system consisting of the St. Joseph’s Hospital in West Bend, Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, and Community Memorial Hospital in Menomonee Falls. Patients coming from all 3 hospitals have been impacted and violation notice letters had been delivered earlier in the week.
The virus was identified on December 14, 2012, and it’s understood that it might possibly have permitted hackers to get into the Safeguarded Health Details – and private identifiers – saved in the worker’s computer account.
In a declaration informing the violation, Froedtert Health described that it enrolled the assistance of a computer forensics organization to carry out an inquiry to ascertain the level of the infection and whether or not it constituted a HIPAA violation.
The forensics organization was not able to ascertain whether hackers had really been capable to see any of the information in the account, however, was “unable to definitively eliminate the probability the virus managed to get details.”

A spokesman for Froedtert Health informed 12 News that the inquiry was started immediately after the finding of the virus, however, it required several weeks to carry out, which clarifies the delay in delivering violation notice letters. The info that was probably accessed incorporated patient names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, medical insurance details as well as some clinical info. The Social Security numbers of some patients were also saved in the computer account.

 The information would typically include the patient’s name, medical record number, diagnostic description and impression of the tissue under review. No financial information, including social security numbers, was part of this protected PHI.
 
 The Bloomsburg Hospital—which became part of Geisinger Health System on July 1, 2012, completed a thorough search to locate the missing records.

2010,GEISINGER WYOMING VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER,PA,Theft,Email,"Geisinger Health System, a physician-led healthcare system of northeastern and central Pennsylvania, has notified approximately 2,928 patients that some of their protected health information (PHI) was disclosed in an unauthorized manner.
 --
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is investigating if a Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center physician violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act when he sent patients' protected health information to his home e-mail.
 
 The maximum penalty for a HIPAA violation is $1.5 million, but it depends on the violation and the nature of the case, said Rachel Seeger, a senior health information privacy outreach specialist at the U.S. Health and Human Services.
 
 HIPAA federal privacy rules establish national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information.
 
 According to letters Geisinger Health System sent to nearly 3,000 patients, Dr. David C. Schaefer, a former gastroenterologist at Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Plains Township, sent protected health information from a Geisinger computer to his home e-mail account in an un-ecrypted manner so he could analyze his procedures. Schaefer no longer works for Geisinger and could not be reached for comment.
 
 When there is a breach of information affecting more than 500 people, Geisinger is required to notify the patients, the media and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in compliance with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, Seeger said.
 
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has not yet confirmed if there was a violation of HIPAA or if the incident occurred, Seeger said.
 
 If it is confirmed, the first thing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will do is post the incident on its website, she said.
 
 According to a news release from Geisinger, the information included patient names, Geisinger medical records, procedures, indications and the physician's brief impressions regarding the care provided. It did not include addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, patient account information or financial information that could make affected patients vulnerable to identity theft.
 
 Officials at Geisinger became aware of the disclosure on Nov. 6, but believe the incident occurred on or about Nov. 3, when a former Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center gastroenterologist e-mailed the PHI from a Geisinger computer to his home email account in an un-encrypted manner. The physician had sent this information to his home computer to complete an analysis of his procedures, said officials.
 
 The information included patient names, Geisinger medical record numbers, procedures, indications and the physician's brief impressions regarding the care provided. It did not include addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, patient account information or any financial information that could make affected patients vulnerable to financial identity theft, officials said.
 
 ""Immediately upon speaking with the physician, he contacted and authorized his home e-mail provider to delete the protected health information from its network and servers,"" said Geisinger Privacy Officer John Gildersleeve. ""He also deleted this information from his home computer.""
 
 Officials have notified patients as part of Geisinger's health information security program and in compliance with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009.
 
 ""We have reviewed our internal practices and taken appropriate action to avoid reoccurrence,"" said Gildersleeve. ""With the short time frame and the doctor's forthright explanation, we believe there is little risk that the protected health information was seen by anyone other than the physician himself. We take our commitment to maintaining our patients' privacy seriously and regret any inconvenience this inadvertent disclosure may have caused.""
 
 Gildersleeve emphasized that affected patients have been contacted by mail. ""If you did not receive a letter, your PHI was not included in the email disclosure,"" he said.

 WILKES-BARRE — The Geisinger Health System could get hit with a hefty fine because a doctor at Geisinger Wyoming Valley used e-mail to send patient information to his home computer, a possible violation of strict federal health privacy rules that took effect this year.
 
 On Monday, Geisinger announced that it notified 2,928 patients that on or about Nov. 3, protected health information was e-mailed to a home account of a former Geisinger gastroenterologist. The information included, patient names, Geisinger medical records, procedure, indications and the physician’s brief impressions regarding the care provided.
 
 “It was a limited amount of information that was sent, and it did not include Social Security numbers, phone numbers or addresses,” said Geisinger spokeswoman Marcy Marshall on Tuesday.
 
 None of the patients are from Northumberland, Snyder, Montour or Union counties, Marshall said. Marshall would not provide the name of the doctor and said she couldn’t disclose any other information except that the physician left Geisinger on Dec. 1. Rachel Seeger, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said an investigation will get under way when the department confirms the incident.
 
 “After we make sure this happened, and we speak to everyone, then we will start to interview people and make the trip to Geisinger,” she said. “Geisinger did what it is supposed to do by informing us of what had happened and now we will take the proper steps.”
 
  Depending what the Health and Human Services finds, Seeger said the doctor could face criminal charges. The penalties are included in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which took effect this year as part of the federal government’s push to encourage hospitals to make greater use of electronic medical records. A list of similar incidents provided by Seeger showed that at least 500 medical facilities across the nation have been sanctioned for mishandling or losing track of personal information about patients. While the $1.5 million fine is possible, it was not immediately clear Tuesday if any medical facility has been hit with fines of that magnitude since the rules took effect.
 
 “There could be legal charges depending on the nature of the incident,” Seeger said.“If the case is determined to be a legal matter, then we turn it over to the Department of Justice.” Each incident that is reported can have several violations, Seeger said.
 
 “The maximum penalty for each breech could be up to $1.5 million,” Seeger said. “There could be more then one violation found in any case.”
 There was nothing in the e-mail that could affect patients vulnerability to financial identity theft, Geisinger said in a press release.
 
 “Immediately upon speaking with the physician, he contacted and authorized his home e-mail provider to delete the protected health information from its network and servers,” said Geisinger privacy officer John Gildersleeve. “He also deleted this information from his home computer.”

 PRINCETON, IN (WFIE) - Gibson General Hospital has mailed letters to patients informing them of the theft of a hospital laptop containing personal health information.
 
 The laptop was reported stolen, along with several other items, from an employee's home during a burglary on Nov. 27.
 
 The hospital says it took immediate steps to investigate and attempt to recover the laptop and to prevent further access to its information system via the laptop, which had security features in place, including password protection.
 
 The laptop has not yet been recovered, but Gibson General Hospital administration continues to work closely with local law enforcement in their investigation.
 
 ""There is no evidence to believe that the data on the laptop was the target of the theft or that any information has been or will be accessed for fraudulent purposes,"" said Emmett Schuster, Gibson General Hospital president & CEO. ""As a precautionary measure and part of Gibson General Hospital's commitment to protecting patient privacy, we are notifying all patients potentially impacted by the incident.""
 
 The laptop was used by a hospital employee whose job requires 24/7 access to the hospital's electronic medical records system.
 
 Information accessed on that laptop may have automatically been saved to the laptop by the software utilized to perform those job duties. Without the laptop, the hospital is unable to determine with certainty whose information is affected.

 The privacy breach was discovered in June 2016, although it is unclear when the nurse first started inappropriately accessing patient data. Glendale Adventist Medical Center discovered patient data were being accessed during a routine security review.
 
 An investigation into the privacy violations was launched after access logs showed that the employee had been abusing data access privileges. The nurse had been provided with access to ePHI in order to perform work duties. The former employee worked as a per-diem nurse according to a report in the Los Angeles Times.
 
 The investigation into the privacy breaches is ongoing, and as such, only a limited amount of information has been released. A spokesperson for Glendale Adventist Medical Center did confirm with the L.A Times that sensitive patient information that was potentially accessed included names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and medical diagnoses. It is unclear whether data were accessed out of curiosity or whether information was accessed with malicious intent.

2013,Glens Falls Hospital (via Portal Healthcare Solutions),NY,DISC,Other,"The medical records of more than 2,300 Glens Falls Hospital patients were stored for more than four months on an unprotected computer server, and the hospital’s investigation into whether the sensitive information was illicitly accessed is ongoing.
 
 The hospital announced Thursday that a forensic audit determined that an outside records contractor, Portal Healthcare Solutions LLC, stored thousands of notes from doctors on an unprotected server between early November and mid-March, according to Glens Falls Hospital spokeswoman Darlene Raynsford. “There’s no way to tell how the records were accessed, or even if any actually were,” she said.
 
 Portal Healthcare was contracted to store transcribed versions of handwritten doctors’ notes, which typically include diagnoses, test results and emergency department records, she said. The hospital’s forensic auditors concluded that some of the records “may” have been accessed or downloaded. The open server was ordered to be taken offline as soon as the hospital, on March 14, became aware of the situation, Raynsford said. Glens Falls Hospital has cut ties with Portal Healthcare, Raynsford said, and notices have been sent to potentially impacted patients. Social Security numbers, addresses and financial information were not stored on the Portal Healthcare system, Raynsford said.

 In a statement to PHIprivacy.net, the firm’s CEO, A. K. Jay Jaiswal, acknowledged that through human error, a secure server’s firewall settings left it open to unrestricted access. That problem only existed from March 5 – March 14, however, he says. As soon as Portal was notified of the problem, the problem was corrected, and access logs were provided to the hospital for their forensic experts to examine. Both the hospital and Portal agree that the examination has revealed no access to the files and no downloads. “Not a single document was showing a third party access,” Jaiswal stated in his e-mailed statement to PHIprivacy.net.

2011,Good Samaritan Hospital,MD,PHYS,Other,"Barrels of X-ray film set to be destroyed were stolen from Good Samaritan Hospital in Baltimore by a man posing as a vendor employee, police said.
 
 According to a Baltimore City police report, officers were called to the hospital Friday morning to investigate the theft of as many as two barrels of old X-ray film. Hospital officials said the films were “more than 5 years old” and the films “had been put aside to be either destroyed or recycled.”
 
 “It appears he did this by misrepresenting himself as the vendor responsible for the disposing and/or the recycling of those items,” Baltimore police spokesman Kevin Brown said.
 
 A statement released by Good Samaritan Hospital suggests the assailant’s motive may have been to extract and sell the silver contained in the films: “There is no clinical impact to patient care as medical reports associated with those films remain with the patient records.

2019,Goshen Health,IN,HACK,Email,"Goshen Health in Indiana has started notifying 9,160 patients that some of their protected health information (PHI) may have been compromised in a phishing-related email breach in August 2018.
 
 Upon discovery of the breach the compromised email accounts were secured and the breach was investigated. At the time, the security breach was determined not to require notifications to patients as PHI did not appear to have been compromised. However, on August 1, 2019, Goshen Health became aware that the compromised email accounts did contain the PHI of certain patients and notification letters were necessary.
 
 The breach occurred between August 2, 2018 and August 13, 2018. An unidentified, unauthorized individual gained access to the email accounts of two Goshen colleagues. Following the breach, Goshen Health enhanced its email security protections and as part of that process used additional forensic tools and technology to re-evaluate the breach.
 
 Third-party forensics experts were retained in November 2018 to reassess the incident, but no evidence of unauthorized PHI access or PHI theft was uncovered. Part of the evaluation involved a detailed search of the compromised email accounts to determine whether they contained any sensitive patient information. Almost a year to the day after the first account compromise, the accounts were contained to contain the PHI of certain patients.
 
 The PHI in the accounts included names, addresses, dates of birth, health insurance information, physicians’ names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and limited clinical information.
 
 The breach was reported to the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights on September 30, 2019 and notification letters were sent to affected patients the same day. Individuals whose Social Security number or driver’s license number were exposed have been offered 12 months of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.
 
 Further training has now been provided to staff members related to email security and phishing awareness.
 
 Sometimes, an incident that doesn’t appear to require notification may require notification under HIPAA. In an August, 2018 incident reported on The Elkhart Truth that involved Goshen Health, the health system originally determined that no notification was required, but when forensic investigators came in months later and looked for any information that might have been accessible, the entity learned that there was a possibility. And so more than a year after their first discovery of the incident, Goshen Health first notified potentially affected patients. The release from Goshen appears below. The number of patients being notified was not disclosed, but this incident may show up on HHS’s public breach tool at some point. Goshen Health (“Goshen”) announced today that it is addressing a security incident that involved the personal information of some of its patients. Goshen has launched an internal investigation, notified individuals who may have been impacted and implemented additional security measures to prevent future occurrences. An unauthorized third party may have potentially accessed two Goshen Colleagues’ email accounts from approximately August 2, 2018 to August 13, 2018. At that time, however, it did not appear that notification to any patients was required. As Goshen continued to enhance its email security, it employed additional forensic tools and technology and retained outside forensic experts in November 2018 to re-evaluate the incident. There was no indication that any personal information was actually viewed or acquired by the unauthorized party. Nevertheless, as part of its investigation, an intensive search occurred for any personal information in the email accounts that could have been viewed. On August 1, 2019, Goshen determined that the accounts contained some of its patients’ personal information. The type of information at issue varied for each individual, but may have included an individual’s name, address, date of birth, physician name, health insurance information, limited clinical information, Social Security number and driver’s license number. On September 30, 2019, Goshen began sending written notifications to all potentially impacted individuals for whom it has contact information, and arranged for complimentary identity theft protection services for those individuals whose Social Security numbers and/or driver’s license numbers were involved in the incident.

2008,Grady Memorial Hospital,GA,INSD,Other,"ATLANTA - Officials say the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the theft of medical records of patients at Grady Memorial Hospital.
 
 Grady spokeswoman Denise Simpson provided few details on the thefts Friday. They were discovered late Thursday. She said it wasn't known how many patient records were stolen, which patients were affected or how the records were stolen. The missing records were kept on computer files.
 
 The records pertained to recorded physician comments. Grady officials do not believe the records contained Social Security numbers or financial information about patients.
 
 Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Ga. The news is reporting that patient info was stolen by some transcription employees who worked for an outsourced company who again outsourced some of the work. Anybody know which company does transcription for Grady..I'm just curious. Please email me if you know.
 
 Here is the article from the Atlanta Journal Constitution:
 
 The FBI is investigating the theft of medical records of patients at Grady Memorial Hospital, officials said Friday.
 
 Grady spokeswoman Denise Simpson provided few details on the thefts that were discovered late Thursday. She said it remains unknown how many patient records were stolen, which patients were affected or how the records were stolen.
 
 The records pertained to recorded physician comments that Grady sent to a vendor to transcribe into medical notes. The records were stolen from a subcontractor employed by the vendor. The missing records were kept on computer files.
 
 Grady officials do not at this point believe the records contained patients' Social Security numbers or financial information such as credit card numbers, but Simpson emphasized that investigators are only starting their inquiry.
 
 Simpson did not identify either the vendor or subcontractor.
 
 We sincerely regret the occurrence of this breach of confidentiality of patient records in the hands of one of our vendors, Simpson said in a prepared statement, and we are hopeful that our quick response to this theft will significantly reduce any negative consequences for our patients and the physicians who care for them.
 
 She said Grady would notify the patients as soon as possible.
 
 It is unclear who might have stolen the records or for what purpose, she said.",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2019,Grays Harbor Community Hospital,WA,HACK,Electronic Medical Record,"Two hospital systems began notifying patients and employees of cyber incidents, one ransomware and another a data breach, that took place in June.
 
 Grays Harbor Community Hospital (GHCH) and Harbor Medical Group, in Aberdeen, Wash., just began informing patients of a ransomware attack that took place on June 15. At that time hospital databases containing patient health information were encrypted and GHCH was presented with a ransom demand. GCCH said in a statement that much of the encrypted data has been recovered, but some is irretrievable.
 
 The information contained in the affected databases included the patient’s full name, date of birth, Social Security number, phone number, home address, insurance, and medical record information, including diagnosis and treatment.
 
 “GHCH and HMG have no reasonable basis to believe that any personal information has been transmitted outside of GHCH’s or HMG’s databases,” the hospital said.
 
 The data breach hit the Naples, Fla.-based, NCH Healthcare System on June 14 when dozens of hospital employees fell for a phishing scam that gave the malicious actors access to the facilities payroll system. The Naples News reported 73 were victimized by the phishing email
 
 NCH officials said in a statement that once the issue was discovered an outside firm was hired to investigate and on July 2 that company determined that it was in fact a phishing scheme that gave entry to the attackers.
 
 “The investigation determined the unauthorized actor could have accessed data present in the email accounts at the time the incident occurred,” NCH said.
 
 The hospital is waiting for the investigation to be completed before it releases the personal information that may or may not have been involved. However, at this time NCH officials do not believe the information involved has been misused.

 Back in July, this site noted a media report about a ransomware attack on Grays Harbor Community Hospital. At the time, and although the incident had first been reported in the media on June 19, the hospital was still not disclosing a lot of details. Yesterday, the hospital issued a formal notice about the breach, as below. The Daily World, which has done a great job of staying on this story, reports that 85,000 patients would be receiving notification: 10,000 from Harbor Medical Group and the remainder from Grays Harbor Community Hospital. They also report that the attackers demanded ransom be paid in BTC that would be valued at more than $1 million at this point. The hospital did not pay.

 Grays Harbor Community Hospital (GHCH) and Harbor Medical Group (HMG) are providing to patients notice of a recent ransomware attack that involved patient health information.
 
 On June 15, 2019, GHCH and HMG discovered that databases containing electronic medical records were encrypted by a sophisticated software program (ransomware) designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid. Upon identifying the ransomware, GHCH and HMG launched an immediate investigation with the support of leading forensics and network consultants, and the investigation is ongoing. GHCH and HMG also notified the FBI of the incident. At no time was patient care compromised and throughout the incident GHCH and HMG continue to care for patients.
 
 After taking the appropriate precautions to safeguard the network, GHCH and HMG used established backup procedures and have been able to recover much of the patient health care information; however, certain parts of the electronic medical record remain encrypted and inaccessible by GHCH and HMG. GHCH and HMG have no reasonable basis to believe that any personal information has been transmitted outside of GHCH’s or HMG’s databases.
 
 The health information that was impacted by the ransomware may have included a patient’s full name, date of birth, social security number, phone number, home address, insurance, and medical record information, including diagnosis and treatment. GHCH and HMG have recovered much of the information that was encrypted but have been unable to recover fully all of the health information that was encrypted.
 
 GHCH and HMG will continue to work diligently with security experts to recover the affected databases and re-establish access to the entire electronic medical record, however, this may not be possible.
 
 Ransomware incidents of this nature are different from other data security incidents in that the data remains within the database. While GHCH and HMG do not believe that any of this personal information was transmitted outside of GHCH’s or HMG’s databases, out of an abundance of caution, GHCH and HMG are notifying patients via letter. GHCH and HMG have arranged for those affected to enroll in a credit monitoring service through Experian. This service is available to those affected at no cost.
 
 GHCH and HMG will continue to take steps to mitigate this incident and to prevent this type of incident from happening again, including implementing more robust security and backup procedures. We also are providing training for staff members to ensure they understand how to avoid malware.

 Q: What happened?
 A: On June 15, 2019 Grays Harbor Community Hospital (GHCH) and Harbor Medical Group (HMG) discovered that databases containing electronic medical records of GHCH’s and HMG’s patients were encrypted by a sophisticated software program (ransomware) that is designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid. This ransomware spread throughout GHCH’s and HMG’s network and encrypted files found on the network.
 
 Q: When did the event occur?
 A: In the early morning of June 15, 2019, our IT department staff members identified unresponsive servers. Upon investigation, they identified the ransomware virus that encrypted files across the network. Our IT department shut down servers in order to stop the spread of the virus and preserve data. Multiple third party IT cyber and network consultants were immediately called in to assist in efforts to recover the data that was encrypted by the virus. GHCH and HMG notified the FBI of this incident.
 
 Q: What kind of information was exposed in this event?
 A: We have no indication at this stage that any data has been exposed or accessed by unauthorized individuals. However, the affected data has been encrypted or “locked away” by the ransomware and has been rendered inaccessible by GHCH and HMG. The affected data includes information about GHCH’s and HMG’s patients found in the medical record, demographics, insurance information, medical history, treatment and billing information. Again, although this data has encrypted by the ransomware virus, we have no reason to believe at this time the that data has been extracted or accessed by unauthorized individuals.
 
 Q: Why am I receiving this letter?
 A: We notified you because our investigation determined that your personal information maintained by GHCH and/or HMG may have been encrypted by the ransomware virus. GHCH and HMG value the privacy and security of its patients’ personal information and want you to be fully informed about this incident. We are also sending you this notice in accordance with our legal requirements under state and federal laws.
 
 Q: Why am I being notified now?
 A: After GHCH and HMG discovered the incident, they immediately launched an investigation so they could understand the impact of the ransomware virus and provide patients with accurate information about the incident. Although the investigation is ongoing, GHCH and HMG believe they now have enough information to provide you with the notice.
 
 Q: What is GHCH and HMG doing to prevent similar events from happening in the future?
 A: GHCH and HMG are working with third-party cybersecurity experts to enhance GHCH’s and HMG’s network security systems and upgrade security protocols. In addition, GHCH and HMG are upgrading the network’s virus protection programs, the network’s real-time monitoring systems, and the network’s operating system. We also have reinforced education and training for our staff members on how to avoid email phishing schemes and take proper precautions for cybersecurity.
 
 Q: What services are GHCH and HMG offering to me?
 A: GHCH and HMG will be offering Experian Credit Monitoring to those whose information was affected by the ransomware. Affected patients will receive a letter with instructions about how to enroll and account information.
 
 Q: Who is Kroll? I thought my information was being held by GHCH and HMG?
 A: Kroll is a nationally-recognized cybersecurity company that has been hired by GHCH and HMG to assist you in obtaining credit monitoring services following the incident.
 
 Q: Why do I have to provide you with my Social Security Number for credit monitoring?
 A: Your Social Security Number is your unique identifier with the credit bureaus, and Kroll needs this information in order to assist you in obtaining credit monitoring services.
 
 Q: What if I don’t want to enter my information on a computer?
 A: Kroll offers an offline monitoring option through Experian. You will receive a letter in the mail if there is a change detected on your credit file, as opposed to an email. If you like, we can send you an offline authorization form to fill out and send back to Kroll, which will enable the offline services. The letter will be directly from Kroll and will include instructions on how to complete the form and a self-addressed return envelope will be included for you to send the completed form back to Kroll.
 
 Q: How do I know that the incident actually happened and that the notification letter is not fraudulent or a scam?
 A: Federal and state laws require that we notify you by mail. We can assure you that this incident did occur and thus we are offering the support identified within the notification letter. We would encourage you to take advantage of the credit monitoring services provided and call us at the number noted within the letter if you have further questions or concerns.
 
 Q: Why hasn’t GHCH or HMG paid the ransom to get the affected information back?
 A: The FBI advised GHCH and HMG not to pay the ransom demanded by the individuals who created the ransomware. One key issue is that paying the ransom will not guarantee that access to the information will be restored.
 
 Q: Does GHCH or HMG know who was behind this?
 A: GHCH and HMG do not know who is responsible for the incident, and it is a matter of ongoing investigation.
 
 Q: Does/will this incident affect medical care?
 A: At this time, we have no reason to believe that this incident has or will affect patient care. However, some of your medical records may be inaccessible as a result of this incident, so we encourage you to provide full and complete answers to questions asked by your provider at your next appointment at GHCH or HMG, including information related to your prescription medications and current symptoms.

 August 14, 2019 - Hackers infected Washington-based Grays Harbor Community Hospital and Harbor Medical Group with ransomware and demanded a payment of $1 million to unlock patient files, according to a report from the Daily World.
 
 The report sheds light on the EHR downtime the provider put into place after experiencing persistent issues with its EHR systems in June. Both the hospital and HMG’s clinics were impacted by the issues with its MEDITECH EHR. However, officials did not explain the cause.
 
 According to the latest, the hackers infected the computer systems with ransomware nearly two months ago when an employee clicked on a malicious link contained in a phishing email. The cyberattack began on a weekend when Grays Harbor IT staff was limited.
 
 During the initial days, staff treated it as an IT issue and officials said servers were turned off the Monday after the attack to contain the infection. However, the ransomware had rapidly spread within the first days of the attack.
 
 Grays Harbor clinics were hit harder by the attack, as the hospital’s older software prevented the ransomware from properly installing on the main system. The ransomware was more effective at the clinics, where medical records, prescriptions, and other functions are still down.
 
 Patient records are still available at the hospital, while the clinics are still operating on paper. Officials stressed that patient care was not impacted, with surgeries, emergency care, and routine appointments continuing as scheduled.
 
 But some appointments were delayed, and patients were asked to bring their prescriptions and other medical histories with them at the time of care. Additionally, Grays Harbor experienced a five-day period where payments could not be processed, which officials said was a large issue for the “cash-strapped” operation.
 
 The money was not lost, but the timing and cash-flow was problematic. Grays Harbor does have cyber insurance with a $1 million cap, which officials are hoping will cover the damage. Officials said the insurance company caused of the lack of transparency, as they were in charge of the response and investigation.
 
 The situation is still ongoing, and officials have contacted the FBI to alert them to the security incident. The report did not explain whether the hospital paid the ransom. What’s more, about 85,000 patients are being notified that their data was compromised during the event. Although officials said there’s currently no evidence of disclosure.
 
 Grays Harbor did have traditional anti-virus and backups in place before the ransomware attack, but even the backups were infected. Officials said they have not yet determined whether the missing records are permanently gone.
 
 Officials are concerned about the ongoing attack, as just a year ago the hospital’s future was still in limbo given “crippling debt.” Ransomware causes some of the largest devastation of cyberattacks, with recent reports showing ransomware payments have increase 184 percent during the second quarter of 2019. The average downtime lasts nearly 10 days.
 
 Grays Harbor is just the latest provider to experience a long period of downtime due to ransomware. After falling victim to two ransomware attacks in the course of two months and experiencing nearly eight weeks of downtime, Kentucky-based Park DuValle Community Health Center paid hackers $70,000 to unlock its records.
 --
 A ransomware attack on an Aberdeen, WA-hospital and associated clinics is still causing problems two months after the attack occurred. The attackers have demanded $1 million for the keys to unlock the encryption.
 
 On June 15, 2019, Grays Harbor Community Hospital started experiencing IT problems. The attack occurred on a Saturday when staffing was limited so initially the problem was attributed to an IT issue. On Monday it became apparent that ransomware was involved and steps were taken to isolate the infection and secure the network; however, the attackers had already moved laterally and had gained access to servers and the systems used by Harbor Medical Group clinics. The initial point of attack appears to have been a response to a phishing email by a single employee.
 
 Harbor Medical Group operates 8 clinics in the Aberdeen and Hoquiam region, and those clinics were the worst affected by the attack. Grays Harbor Community Hospital used older software, which prevented the ransomware from being installed on the hospital’s main computer system. The clinics used more recent software, which allowed the attackers to infect more systems. Those systems are still down at the clinics, which are using pen and paper to record patient information.
 
 A spokesperson for the hospital said patient care has not been affected. The hospital is continuing to provide emergency care to patients and appointments are going ahead as scheduled. There have been some delays to appointments and there are still issues accessing patient information. Patients have been told to bring details of their prescriptions and their medical histories and to make that information available at point of care.
 
 The hospital had created backups but it was not possible to recover files as the backups had also been encrypted. As of August 13, 2019, the hospital still had not regained access to its files. The attack has been reported to the FBI and the hospital is assisting with its investigation.
 
 The hospital had previously taken out a cybersecurity insurance policy for $1 million, which may cover the ransom payment. It is unclear whether the ransom has been paid.
 
 No evidence of data access or theft was found, but the possibility could not be discounted. Affected patients had the following information exposed: Full name, address, phone number, date of birth, Social Security number, insurance information, diagnoses, and treatment information.
 
 The hospital has started notifying the 85,000 patients affected by the breach and each has been offered complimentary credit monitoring services. Security measures are being assessed at the hospital and medical group and additional hardware and software solutions will be implemented as appropriate to improve security. Employees will also be provided with additional training.
 
 Update: 08/26/19: The HHS’ Office for Civil Rights breach portal indicates 88,399 patients were affected by the breach.",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,3.0,88399.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2011,Grays Harbor Pediatrics,WA,PORT,Other,"Grays Harbor Pediatrics discovered on November 23, 2010 that a computer backup device was stolen from a Grays Harbor Pediatric employee. The backup device was used for storing copies of paper records. Grays Harbor Pediatrics has notified all patients and patient billing guarantors.

 Great thanks to Grays Harbor Pediatrics for getting back to me with answers to some questions I sent them about their substitute notice concerning a stolen backup device. According to their emailed statement to this site, the backup device was stolen from the employee’s car. In response to my question as to whether the data were supposed to have been encrypted under their policies, a spokesperson answered that “The backup device was password protected,” which was a somewhat non-responsive answer. The statement also indicates that police were notified of the theft and that 12,009 patient records were affected. All patients have been notified of the incident

 Security breaches plagued two Midwestern health systems in recent months, and a class-action lawsuit has been filed against one of them, alleging HIPAA violations. One expert says such suits are becoming more common, and that providing as much information as possible about the incident could help in preventing lawsuits. Sisters of St. Francis Health Services, Inc., which owns several hospitals in Indiana and Illinois, experienced a breach in July and is now named in a classaction lawsuit brought by one of its patients. The company hired Advanced Receivables Strategy (ARS) of Nashville, Tenn., for medical billing services, and one of ARS’s employees downloaded patient information onto some CDs “as part of her work effort and without any malicious intent,” according to an Oct. 13 letter sent to patients by ARS.
 
 The employee packed her laptop and CDs into a computer bag, but decided that the bag was too small and returned it to the store for a refund, inadvertently leaving the CDs in the bag, ARS explains in the letter. Someone bought the bag a few days later, discovered the CDs and returned them to St. Francis, the letter says. The patient information includes names and Social Security numbers, but ARS says its investigation found no fraud or other crime. “[It] is highly unlikely your personal information was compromised,” ARS says in its letter. The lawsuit was filed in October against St. Francis; Greater Lafayette Health Systems, Inc. (GLHS), which is owned by St. Francis; ARS; Perot Systems Corp., which owns ARS; and the ARS employee, who is identified as
 Jane Doe in the suit. The suit was brought by Michael Chaney, who has been a patient of St. Francis and GLHS, and is one of
 260,000 patients whose personal information was “improperly, unlawfully, willfully and intentionally” disclosed by the companies, according to the suit.
 The disclosures were the result of the companies’ failure to establish and enforce the proper safeguards to ensure privacy and security of patient records, the suit says. Also, the “defendants were deliberately indifferent in failing to take reasonable corrective action,
 including…failure to provide prompt and accurate notification of the disclosures to the patients ….” Chaney and anyone who joins the suit are seeking
 $5,000 in damages, plus attorney fees and “an award of such other relief in law…,” the suit says. Spokespersons from GLHS and Perot said they could not comment on the incident because of the lawsuit.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,266200.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,5000.0,0.0
2016,Greenville Health System,SC,DISC,Other,"About one-fifth of the cardiac-monitored patients at the Greenville Health System’s Carolina Cardiology Consultants were affected by a recent data breach, GHS officials announced today.
 
 Some personal information from around 2,500 patients was downloaded inappropriately by a former employee of Ambucor Health Solutions, a national company that provides remote-monitoring labor service for cardiac devices. All of the people who were affected will be notified by Delaware-based Ambucor, which is working with law enforcement in the investigation, which began in July, 2016.
 
 So far, Ambucor officials say that they have no indication that the personal data had been misused. Also, the patient information did not include credit or debit card numbers, medical insurance, or Medicare/Medicaid numbers, or other financial information, according to GHS.
 
 The downloaded information may have included:
 
 patient’s name
 patient’s date of birth
 patient identification number
 patient’s phone number, address, race
 patient’s diagnosis, medications, testing data
 medical device information, including the manufacturer, identification number, and model/serial numbers;
 Ambucor enrollment number, enrollment date, technician name, and
 the physician name and name and address of practice where the patient was seen.
 Ambucor told GHS of only one patient whose social security information was downloaded.
 
 As a precaution, Ambucor will offer affected patients — at no charge — a year of identity protection services and related recovery services, as well as $1 million of identity theft insurance. The company also is taking steps to prevent this type of data breach from recurring.
 
 “GHS and Carolina Cardiology Consultants take patient privacy seriously and deeply regret any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause our patients,” said Dr. Josephy Manfredi, ambulatory director of electrophysiology.
 
 Next week, affected patients will receive letters with instructions for activating the free identity protection services. Patients also can call Ambucor’s dedicated call center at 866-313-7933 or the GHS Privacy Office at 864-797-7755.

 Approximately 2,500 patients of Greenville Health System in South Carolina have been affected by a privacy incident involving one of the health system’s vendors: Delaware-based Ambucor Health Solutions.
 
 Ambucor Health Solutions provides a remote-monitoring labor service for cardiac devices. According to the substitute breach notice on the Greenville Health System website, a former Ambucor Health Solutions employee downloaded some electronic protected health information from the company prior to leaving employment.
 
 The data were downloaded without authorization, although two flash drives containing patient data were subsequently turned over to law enforcement, which notified Ambucor Health Solutions in July this year.
 
 The data on the storage devices were discovered to contain a range of ePHI of patients of GHS’ Carolina Cardiology Consultants. Approximately one fifth of cardiac-monitored patients were affected by the privacy breach.
 
 The data on the devices included the names of patients, their dates of birth, phone numbers, home addresses, race, prescribed medications, medical diagnoses, patient ID numbers, testing data, Ambucor enrollment numbers and enrollment dates, physicians’ names, Ambucor technicians’ names, the locations where patients were being seen, and details of the medical device that had been fitted – including model numbers, serial numbers, and id numbers. Only one patient’s Social Security number was present on the storage devices. No financial data, Medicare/Medicaid numbers, debit or credit card numbers were copied to the devices.
 
 While the incident was discovered in July, it took until late September 2016 for Ambucor Health Solutions to complete a detailed forensic analysis of the storage devices. However, it has taken a further two months for patients to be notified of the breach.
 
 According to the breach notice on Greenville Health System’s website – dated November 4, 2016 – “Letters with instructions about activating the free identity protection services will be mailed to affected patients next week.” Patients will be offered one year of identity theft protection services and a $1 million identity theft insurance policy “out of an abundance of caution.”
 
 Greenville Health System has confirmed that “Any third party that handles GHS patient information must contractually agree to implement and maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the confidentiality of that information.” Ambucor Health Solutions has committed to take steps to prevent future breaches of this nature. Those steps include “a thorough review of and updates to all HIPAA security processes.”
 
 A breach report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights on July 22, 2016 by Ambucor Health Solutions indicates the company experienced an “Unauthorized Access/Disclosure” incident involving email and an “other portable electronic device.” The breach report indicates 1,679 individuals were impacted. It is unclear whether this latest announcement is a separate breach or whether the investigation revealed more records were copied than was originally thought.

 Some patients at Greenville Health System have been affected by an incident that happened at Ambucor Health Solutions. Ambucor Health Solutions is a national leader in remote-monitoring labor service for cardiac devices. About 2,500 patients at GHS have been affected after their personal information was inappropriately downloaded by a former Ambucor employee shortly before his employment at Ambucor ended. Of note, the breach was first discovered by law enforcement: In July, law enforcement provided Ambucor with two flash drives that the former employee turned over to them after his departure from the company. After Ambucor found that personal information had been downloaded, they began notifying affected providers, including GHS. Read more on WSPA.",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,2500.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2014,Greenwood Leflore Hospital,MS,Theft,Other,"Greenwood Leflore Hospital in Greenwood, Mississippi has notified 3,750 patients after five bins of old x-rays with limited patient information was stolen from hospital grounds. From the notice posted on their website: Notice to Patients of X-Ray Films Made in 2007 or Earlier That Were Removed from the Hospital Without Authorization We are providing this notice as part of Greenwood Leflore Hospital’s commitment to patient privacy. We take patient privacy very seriously, and it is important to us that you are made fully aware of a potential privacy issue. Although there is a very low risk to patients, we want to let the public know about a recent incident that occurred on the Greenwood Leflore Hospital campus which resulted in limited patient protected health information (PHI) being released. On February 24, 2014, Greenwood Leflore Hospital discovered that five containers of x-ray film were removed from the hospital premises without authorization. Each container held approximately 750 pieces of x-ray film. The film contains limited information that includes name, date of birth, x-ray number, the x-ray image and the hospital’s name. There was no financial information or other sensitive information such as Social Security number included on these films. All the film at issue is from 2007 or earlier, and was due to be destroyed in compliance with state law pursuant to Greenwood Leflore Hospital’s document retention policy. Greenwood Leflore Hospital has reported this incident to the police and a suspect has been arrested. We believe the motive for the suspect’s actions was to obtain the recyclable material and not for the limited information the xray film contained. In order for the recyclable material to be extracted, the films must go through a process which ultimately destroys them. While Greenwood Leflore Hospital pursued all available avenues to recover the containers of film removed from the hospital without authorization, Greenwood Leflore Hospital currently believes the film has been destroyed. Greenwood Leflore Hospital is also reviewing its security policies and training procedures to prevent any similar incidents from occurring in the future. Because the only identifiable patient information contained on the film consists of the x-ray image, xray number, patient name, date of birth and the hospital’s name, we believe the risk of identity theft is low. However, if you are concerned about potential identity theft, we recommend that you contact a major credit bureau to place a fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent an identity thief from opening accounts in your name. We understand that this may pose an inconvenience to you. We sincerely apologize and regret that this situation has occurred. Greenwood Leflore Hospital is committed to providing quality care, including protecting your personal information, and we want to assure you that we have policies and procedures in place to protect your privacy. If you have any questions or would like to learn whether your protected health information may have been included in the x-ray films removed from the hospital without authorization, please call our toll-free telephone number at 1-844-405-6939",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,3750.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2010,Griffin Hospital,CT,HACK,Network Server,"DERBY, CT (March 29, 2010) - Griffin Hospital has notified 957 patients of an apparent breach of personal protected health information during the period from February 4, 2010 to March 5, 2010 after an investigation prompted by patient inquires revealed the breach.
 
 Based on information available to it, Griffin Hospital has reason to believe that a radiologist previously, but not currently, affiliated with the hospital or on the Griffin Hospital Medical Staff accessed patient radiology reports on the hospital's Digital Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) using the passwords of other radiologists and an employee within the Radiology Department. The passwords were obtained and/or used without their knowledge.
 
 PACS is a computer-based, digital image archiving system that maintains encrypted data of patient's radiological images that are accessible only through a user name and password entry system. The PACS system allows authorized physician users to access radiology study images through a secured network from workstations in the hospital and from remote locations outside the hospital.
 
 From the investigation conducted by Griffin Hospital it appears the physician who gained unauthorized access scanned the PACS directory listings of 957 patients who had radiology studies performed at Griffin Hospital during the period and selected and entered (downloaded) the image files of 339 of these patients.
 
 On and after February 26, 2010, Griffin Hospital received inquiries on behalf of patients regarding unsolicited contact by the physician who offered to perform professional services at another area hospital despite the patients' interest in having those services provided at Griffin Hospital. The inquiries prompted the investigation that revealed unauthorized intrusions into Griffin Hospital's PACS and, thereby, the breach of protected patient health information.
 
 The physician was formerly a member of the Griffin Hospital medical staff who had been employed by the radiology group with which Griffin Hospital contracted for its radiology professional services. During that time the physician did have authorized access to the PACS. Thereafter, the physician's employment with the radiology group was terminated on February 3, 2010. That resulted in the loss of his medical staff appointment at Griffin Hospital and his authorization to access PACS. At the same time as the physician's PACS access was terminated his access password was revoked.
 
 Prompted by the initial patient inquiries, Griffin Hospital launched an investigation that included an audit of information captured by PACS that revealed the repeated, unauthorized access from a single computer at a particular Internet Protocol (I.P.) address using the password of other physicians and employees. Every device connected to the public Internet is assigned a unique number known as an Internet Protocol address. Further analysis identified the individual/physician to whom the I.P. address was assigned.
 
 The audit revealed the scope of the breach and that protected patient information had been accessed. Once the investigation reached this point, the hospital immediately engaged legal counsel who issued a cease and desist demand to the physician on March 5, 2010. All of the individual patients whose protected health information could have been accessed through the breach have been notified of the details of the breach by mail. Griffin Hospital has changed all of the passwords for PACS users whose passwords were identified as having been used without authorization. It has also advised all users of the need for strict password confidentiality.
 
 The information accessed in the PACS directory scanned included: patient name, exam date, exam description, gender, age, medical record number and date of birth. The patient's Social Security number and patient financial information are not information in the directory accessed. As a result, it would appear that there is no further action patients need to take to protect them from future harm resulting from the breach.
 
 ""Griffin Hospital has stringent policies, procedures and systems in place to protect patient information and takes very seriously our obligation to safeguard the personal and health information of our patients,"" said Griffin Hospital President Patrick Charmel. ""This breach, however, appears to have been a deliberate intrusion into Griffin Hospital's Digital Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) to view patient radiology reports. We acted quickly to complete an audit and investigation and to notify affected patients. As a result of this breach, steps are underway to further strengthen the security of patient information. We regret that this incident has occurred, and are committed to prevent future such occurrences,"" Charmel said.
 
 Griffin Hospital is following all of the requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act which includes: notification of the U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, notification of patients that may have had their personal protected health information accessed in the breach, public disclosure to the local media through media notification, and posting information about the breach on Griffin Hospital's website. Griffin Hospital officials have also notified the Office of Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal about the breach.
 --
 The doctor allegedly accessed the records of almost 1,000 patients and downloaded the information of 339 of them, according to hospital officials, who became aware of the problem when those patients began calling the hospital asking why they were being solicited.
 
 ""Based on information available to it, Griffin Hospital has reason to believe that a radiologist previously, but not currently, affiliated with the hospital or on the Griffin Hospital medical staff accessed patient radiology reports ...using the passwords of other radiologists and an employee within the Radiology Department,"" according to a statement vice-president of operations William Powanda released Monday.
 
 ""The passwords were obtained and/or used without their knowledge."" Powanda said he couldn't identify the doctor involved. ""We are basically prohibited from commenting further, based on privacy guidelines we are forced to abide by,"" he said.
 
 ""These charges, if true, are deeply disturbing,"" Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said. ""Patients rightly expect and demand that their medical information remain secure and confidential, viewed only by authorized individuals.
 
 ""Unauthorized accessing of patient information is a violation of federal HIPAA (privacy) law that my office is empowered to enforce,"" Blumenthal said. ""I will seek strong and significant sanctions if warranted by the facts.""
 
 The information accessed included the patient name, exam date, exam description, gender, age, medical record number and date of birth, Powanda said, but didn't include financial information such as Social Security numbers or bank accounts.
 
 ""As a result, it would appear that there is no further action patients need to take to protect them from future harm resulting from the breach,"" he said.
 
 The breach apparently happened between Feb. 4 and March 5, hospital officials said, and involved a ""digital image archiving system that maintains encrypted data of patient's radiological images that are accessible only through a user name and password entry system,"" according to a press release issued Monday. The system ""allows authorized physician users to access radiology study images through a secured network from work stations in the hospital and from remote locations outside the hospital.""
 
 Beginning around Feb. 26, hospital officials began hearing from patients reporting the phone calls from the doctor, Powanda said, which launched the investigation.
 
 ""The physician was formerly a member of the Griffin Hospital medical staff who had been employed by the radiology group with which Griffin Hospital contracted for its radiology professional services,"" Powanda said, but was terminated by the group on Feb. 3.
 
 Before he was terminated, the doctor did have access to the system, Powanda said, but that access was revoked with his termination. Using the Internet Protocol address of the computer used to access the system, investigators were able to identify the doctor, he said.
 
 ""We basically followed what are very prescriptive guidelines related to what is an apparent breach,"" Powanda said, and then notified Blumenthal, as well as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the affected patients.
 
 The hospital also issued a cease and desist order to the physician, ordering him to stop accessing hospital records, he said.
 
 ""Griffin Hospital has stringent policies, procedures and systems in place to protect patient information and takes very seriously our obligation to safeguard the personal and health information of our patients,"" said Patrick Charmel, hospital president. ""This breach, however, appears to have been a deliberate intrusion into Griffin's Digital Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) to view patient radiology reports.
 
 ""We acted quickly to complete an audit and investigation and to notify affected patients. As a result of this breach, steps are under way to further strengthen the security of patient information,"" he said. ""We regret that this incident has occurred, and are committed to prevent future such occurrences.""

 Gerald Micalizzi, MD, a Connecticut radiologist formerly employed by Advanced Mobile Imaging Radiology, has been fined $20,000 after downloading patients’ personal information, according to a Valley Independent Sentinel report.
 
 From Feb. 4, 2010, to March 5, 2010, Micalizzi accessed the records of 957 patients at Griffin Hospital in Derby, Conn., which had contracted with Advanced Mobile Imaging Radiology for imaging work, according to a statement issued by the hospital.
 
 Micalizzi used the passwords of other radiologists, without their permission, to access the hospital’s PACS and download patient information, which he then used to contact patients and tell them he was offering radiology services at another hospital. Some patients then contacted the hospital and asked about the calls from Micalizzi.
 
 “The inquiries prompted the investigation that revealed unauthorized intrusions into Griffin Hospital's PACS and, thereby, the breach of protected patient health information,” read Griffin Hospital’s original statement from 2010.
 
 In addition to the fine, Micalizzi was reprimanded and he now must complete training courses in physician ethics, patient confidentiality and compliance with federal HIPPA regulations, according to the Valley Independent Sentinel report. The Connecticut Medical Examining Board accepted and imposed the disciplinary action on June 19.
 
 Micalizzi’s license will be probationary for six months while he completes the training courses, according to the report.",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,22.0,957.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,20000.0,1.0

2006,Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center,WI,INSD,Other,"The patient liaison at a Wisconsin hospital faces felony charges after allegedly using PHI to apply for fraudulent credit card accounts, according to the Associated Press (AP). As an employee of Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center, in La Crosse, WI, Amy Zielke reportedly used the center's computers to do research on wealthy patients.
 
 Zielke located wealthy neighborhoods and addresses and matched those to patient records, the AP reports. Zielke then had credit card companies send cards to vacant addresses for her use.

 A woman who formerly worked as a patient liaison at a La Crosse hosptal pleads guilty to forgery and identity theft.
 
 Twenty-seven-year-old Amy Zielke entered a plea agreement yesterday in a La Crosse County Circuit Court case on accusations she stole personal information from patients at Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center.
 
 Zielke faces a maximum of six years in prison and six years of extended supervision on the two charges. 
 --
 LA CROSSE, Wis.—A former Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center patient liaison has been placed on three years of probation on charges accusing her of using patient information to steal $3,500 and apply for credit cards.
 
 La Crosse County Circuit Judge Ramona Gonzalez also sentenced Amy Zielke, 27, of La Crosse, to one year on monitoring, a $3,000 fine and court costs.
 
 Zielke, who pleaded guilty to forgery and identity theft April 10, apologized Friday and said she now realizes these were serious offenses.
 
 “I don’t want to make excuses for what I’ve done,” she said. “But I always wanted to buy all of the groceries on my list just once.”
 
 Assistant District Attorney Jessica Skemp did not seek prison because Zielke had no prior record, cooperated with investigators and worked multiple jobs to repay the stolen money.
 
 But the prosecutor argued that Zielke should serve jail time as retribution, and to deter others who handle such information from committing similar crimes.
 
 But Gonzalez rejected a jail sentence, saying that should be reserved for “people we are afraid of” and not “people we are angry with.”
 
 Zielke’s attorney, Keith Belzer, said she has a mental illness and her family had lost $1,400 in an Internet scam before the thefts began.
 --
 former Gundersen Lutheran patient liaison who used Social Security numbers and other information from her job to steal money and apply for credit cards was sentenced today to three years probation, one year on Justice Sanctions and ordered to pay a $3,000 fine plus costs.
 
 Amy L. Zielke, 27, of 345 S. 20th St., pleaded guilty April 10 to forgery and identity theft.
 
 Zielke has admitted that between September and November of 2006, she used personal information from at least 20 patients at Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center steal $3,500.
 
 In court today, Zielke apologized and said she stole to pay bills and groceries for her family after the family lost $1,400 in an Internet scam.
 
 La Crosse County Circuit Court Judge Ramona Gonzalez agreed with the prosecution, defense and a Department of Corrections agent that prison was not appropriate.
 
 Assistant District Attorney Jessica Skemp credited Zielke for a lack of prior crimes, for cooperating with investigators - even providing information she stole but had not used - and for working multiple jobs to repay the money she stole. But, Skemp said, Zielke should serve jail time as retribution and to deter other people who handle such important information from committing similar crimes.
 
 Gonzalez, however, said Zielke should be monitored and not locked up.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,3000.0,1.0
2012,Hackensack University Medical Center,NJ,INSD,Other,"Hackensack University Medical Center officials said a former employee stole information from the records of 445 patients and the hospital has been notifying those patients they could be the victims of identity theft.
 
 The employee, a clerk, took the information from files at an outpatient clinic. The information included patient names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and insurance information, said Thomas Flynn, the hospital’s chief compliance officer.
 
 No medical records were stolen and there was no breach of electronic records at the hospital, Flynn said.
 Hackensack University Medical Center is committed to the privacy and confidentiality of the information entrusted to us. Regrettably, this notice concerns an incident related to that information.
 
 On September 26, 2011, we were informed by law enforcement that a former employee of Hackensack University Medical Center may have stolen patient information prior to September 1, 2011, from one of our outpatient clinics. Specifically, the person may have accessed patient names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and health insurance cards. There were no medical records taken or electronic information affected. We have been actively cooperating with law enforcement in their investigation and were instructed by them to delay any notification or public announcement of this theft until recently so that we did not impede their investigation. Once we were told we could notify our patients, we wanted to notify them as quickly as possible.
 
 As a precaution, HackensackUMC started mailing notification letters on February 29, 2012, to those patients who were affected.

2015,HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Round Rock,TX,Theft,Laptop,"Only a few hours after the announcement of the theft of an unencrypted laptop computer from the vehicle of an employee of the New Mexico Department of Health comes news of another.
 
 The latest laptop theft affects 1,359 patients of the HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Round Rock, TX. An employee of the hospital left an unencrypted laptop computer in the trunk of a vehicle from where it was stolen. As with the NM Department of Health laptop theft, the incident occurred in October. Covered entities have up to two months to issue breach notification letters to patients and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights. The notification letters were sent on Tuesday 22, December and OCR has now been notified.
 
 The theft was discovered by HealthSouth on October 26, 2015, five days after the theft actually took place. Once the theft was discovered, the incident was reported to Austin law enforcement. It is not clear why it took five days for hospital staff and law enforcement officers to be notified. The laptop computer has not subsequently been recovered.
 
 The laptop computer was password protected, so the data would not be accessible without the password being cracked. This protection should ensure that data is not exposed, although hackers are able to crack passwords. Without data encryption there is a possibility that the data stored on the device could be accessed.
 
 The data stored on the laptop include patient names, dates of birth, home addresses, contact telephone numbers, referral ID numbers, and medical record numbers. Social Security numbers, health insurance information, and medical diagnoses were also stored on the device. If the password is cracked, the thieves would have all the information needed for them to commit identity theft and insurance fraud. With tax season almost upon us, it would be the ideal time for the thieves to submit fraudulent tax returns on behalf of the patients.
 
 Unfortunately, the theft occurred before HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital was able to encrypt the laptop. The hospital, formerly known as Reliant Rehabilitation Hospital Central Texas, was taken over by HealthSouth on October 1, 2015.
 
 Reliant did not encrypt data on portable devices, although HealthSouth does ensure all laptop computers are encrypted to reduce the risk of PHI exposure. In accordance with HealthSouth data security policies, all laptop computers were had been scheduled to be updated and encrypted. HealthSouth had ordered the return of all Reliant Rehabilitation Hospital laptop computers, but the theft occurred before the laptop could be recalled.
 
 With the breach notification letters being mailed so close to Christmas, there is a possibility that some will be delayed. Some patients may therefore receive them over two months after the theft was identified, and certainly more than two months after the theft occurred.
 
 While the data breach will come as bad news for patients, they have been offered identity theft protection and credit monitoring services by HealthSouth for a period of one year without charge.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,5.0,1539.0,153900.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2019,"Henderson County Urgent Care Centers, INC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Henderson County Hospital Corporation d/b/a Margaret R. Pardee Memorial Hospi",NC,Theft,Paper/Films,"On May 9, 2019, Pardee UNC Health Care discovered, and filed a police report for, a break-in at our building located at 2029 Asheville Hwy, Hendersonville. The basement of the Asheville Hwy building was illegally accessed, and electronic equipment removed from the premises. The equipment taken did not have hard drives intact and as a result, no Protected Health Information (PHI) or other personal information was accessed via the stolen electronics.
 
 However, during the onsite investigation immediately following the discovery of the break-in, Pardee Security found a stack of 590 Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control forms on a table centrally located in the basement. The Drug Testing Forms contained information related to routine drug screenings performed at Pardee Urgent Care on Thompson Street from October 2003 to December 2004. We believe that the person(s) who illegally entered the building moved the stack of papers from another location in the basement to the table, where they were in plain view. For this reason, we believe that the person(s) who illegally entered the building may have viewed the information contained on the forms.
 
 Notifications
 The Drug Testing Forms did not include contact information, and the individuals who received drug testing were not patients of Pardee Urgent Care. Accordingly, we lack sufficient contact information to send letters to affected individuals. Consistent with state and federal law, which allows for “substitute notice,” we are providing notification through media channels and here on our website.
 
 Types of Data
 Protected Health Information that may have been accessed includes names and phone numbers, birth dates, social security numbers, results of the drug screen, employer name, and drivers license numbers. While we are unaware of any specific data misuse as a result of this breach, we want to make affected individuals aware of this situation and provide the appropriate information to help protect them from potential identity theft.
 
 Steps You Can Take
 Individuals who had a drug screening from October 2003 to December 2004 at the Pardee Urgent Care located at 212 or 205 Thompson Street in Hendersonville are encouraged to call toll free 866-668-4847 to confirm whether your data may have been accessed.
 Review and monitor your credit by placing a fraud alert on your credit report. Contact information for the three major consumer reporting agencies, as well as information on preventing identity theft from the Federal Trade Commission and North Carolina Attorney General’s Office is available here on our website.
 We will provide affected individuals with free credit monitoring protection services for a period of one year.
 Steps We Are Taking
 We are committed to protecting the privacy of patients’ personal information and take this obligation very seriously.
 
 All paper records previously stored in the lower level of the Asheville Highway location where the break-in occurred are now securely stored at a new location.
 We are reinforcing existing employee training on the importance of maintaining the privacy and security of health and other personal information. 
 We have consolidated paper records previously stored at multiple off-site records storage facilities into one secure storage facility.
 We are reviewing existing record retention protocols and policies and will revise as needed.
 Finally, we are notifying the federal Office for Civil Rights and the North Carolina Attorney General’s Office, consistent with state and federal laws regarding data breaches.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2016,Henry County Health Department,OH,Theft,Electronic Medical Record,"A patient at New Hampshire Hospital reportedly hacked into the New Hampshire Department Of Health And Human Services (DHHS), posting information online and creating a potential data breach for 15,000 individuals. Potential data breach at NH hospital from unauthorized access DHHS said in an online statement that it learned on November 4, 2016 that certain internal files had been posted to a social media site. As many as 15,000 DHHS clients who received services from DHHS prior to November 2015 may have had certain information accessed. The affected data includes names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and Medicaid identification numbers. The individual who is believed to have posted the information was reportedly a patient at New Hampshire Hospital, and accessed the data through a computer available for patient use in the hospital library. The data was accessed in October 2015, and the individual was “observed by a staff member to have accessed non-confidential DHHS information on a personal computer located in the New Hampshire Hospital library.” “The staff member notified a supervisor, who took steps to restrict access to the library computers. This incident, however, was not reported to management at New Hampshire Hospital or DHHS. In August 2016, a security official at New Hampshire Hospital informed DHHS that the same individual may have posted on social media some DHHS information. That was immediately reported to the Department of Information Technology, the State Police and other state officials.” DHHS said that there is no evidence that any PHI was misused or that any credit card or banking information was accessed. Individuals who received DHHS services before November 2015 are encouraged to monitor their credit and banking statements, and are told that they “can protect themselves from incidents of identity theft or fraud by reviewing their account statements and monitoring their credit.” “Safeguarding the personal, financial and medical information of DHHS clients is one of this Department’s highest priorities,” DHHS stated. “DHHS will continue to work with state agency partners to make every effort to ensure that the Department’s data remains secure.” Indiana hospital reports PHI made accessible online Indiana-based Fairbanks Hospital recently announced on its website that certain current and former patient PHI was made electronically accessible to Fairbanks employees. Some employees who were not meant to have such PHI access were also given the ability, Fairbanks explained. “The investigation has determined that this issue existed since at least November of 2013, however we are unable to determine whether the issue existed prior to that time,” the hospital said. “We have now corrected this issue so that only the appropriate Fairbanks personnel has electronic access to files containing patient information.” The OCR data breach reporting tool states that 12,994 individuals may have had their information exposed. Potentially affected data included names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, contact information, patient identification numbers, diagnoses, treatment information, health insurance information, and information related to initial admission and appointment scheduling. The information will also vary by patient, Fairbanks explained, adding that the majority of patients are “only having their name and limited information relating to initial admission and scheduling of appointments impacted.” The hospital said it is not aware of any actual or attempted misuse of the information. Identity and credit monitoring services are not being offered, but Fairbanks listed steps that individuals can take if they are concerned for the security of their information. “We encourage you to remain vigilant against incidents of identity theft and fraud, to review your account statements, and to monitor your credit reports and explanation of benefits forms for suspicious activity,” Fairbanks said. “This also includes reviewing account statements, medical bills, and health insurance statements regularly to ensure that no one has submitted fraudulent medical claims using your name and address.” Medical records stolen from vehicle in Ohio Henry County Health Department (HCHD) in Ohio recently announced on its website that some patient records were stolen from an employee’s vehicle, possibly exposing the information of 574 individuals. A health department nurse had her home broken into on October 22, 2016, according to HCHD. The nurse’s car was also stolen from her garage, and it contained a bag with an HCHD laptop and paper records that contained medical information. HCHD added that the nurse was allowed to have the records for her regular duties because she would occasionally visit patients in their homes. The suspect was apprehended and the car returned, but the laptop and medical records were not found. “At this time, we do not know what has become of the laptop and records,” HCHD stated. “However, the investigation revealed that the laptop and records were not the targets of the theft, but rather the unintended cargo of the suspect’s car theft.” The unsecured PHI on the laptop included patient names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, medical diagnoses and codes, medication lists, and medical insurance information. “HCHD has increased security with respect to the laptops that we use and how we handle medical records in the field. While all our laptops utilize a password authentication process we have now encrypted all our laptops to prevent access to laptop files in ways that may circumvent the login process. We have also reviewed and updated our processes and procedures for the handling of laptops and medical records necessary for nurse visitation of patients in their homes.” Potentially affected individuals will also be offered a complimentary one-year membership in a credit/identity theft monitoring service.",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,12994.0,1299400.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2010,Henry Ford Health System,MI,Theft,Laptop,"As an update to previous coverage on the Henry Ford Health System breach involving a stolen laptop containing unencrypted PHI: 1. The breach affected 3,700 patients according to the hospital’s notification to HHS under the breach notification requirement of HITECH. 2. The hospital posted a notice to its web site on Nov. 19: Henry Ford Health System has notified patients who were affected by a breach of unsecured personal health information after learning that an employee’s laptop computer storing the information was stolen from an unlocked urology medical office. While the laptop was password protected, the patient information stored on the computer could potentially be viewed on the computer. As a result of the Sept. 24 theft, Henry Ford notified the affected patients in a letter mailed last week from Chief Privacy Officer Meredith Phillips. The letter explained what happened, what information was stored on the laptop, and what steps the health system is taking to prevent future breaches of patient information. Under federal law, health care organizations are required to notify patients within 60 days of a breach of unsecured health information. “The security of our patients’ health information is very important to us, and we sincerely apologize for what happened,” Phillips says. “This laptop did not have the proper security protections that we require for laptop computers storing patient information.” The laptop contained patient information related to prostate services received between 1997 and 2008 and included some but not all of the following information: Patient name, medical record number, date of birth, mailing and e-mail addresses, telephone number, treatment and doctor visits. No Social Security numbers or health insurance identification numbers were stored on the laptop. While the stolen laptop had elements of patient information, Phillips says, it did not contain the patient’s medical record or allow access into the patient’s medical record. To address any patient questions or concerns, Henry Ford set up a toll-free telephone number – 1.888.313.1027 – that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Additionally, the health system offered the affected patients free credit monitoring for one year from Equifax to ensure their information is not used inappropriately. After learning of the stolen laptop on Sept. 24, Henry Ford launched a thorough investigation to determine the identity of the affected patients and the nature of their information stored on the laptop, and ascertain whether proper security protections were installed. To prevent future patient information breaches, Phillips says employees will be re-educated in the steps necessary to protect patient information stored on computers. She also says the process will be improved for how employees obtain a laptop computer for work purposes.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,3700.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2011,"High Point Regional Health System (via Premier Imaging LLC, a subsidiary)",NC,INSD,Other,"High Point Regional Health System officials said they uncovered a breach involving protected patient information. Hospital representatives became aware early last month of “the possibility of improper use” of confidential information by a former employee of Premier Imaging LLC, a hospital subsidiary, according to the health system. The former employee, who was fired after the breach came to light, had access to patients’ names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and insurance information. An investigation by the health system could not determine whether the former employee has any patient information in her possession or has used it in any way. Hospital officials declined to identify the former employee, who worked for Premier Imaging for about five weeks. They contacted High Point police about the breach, which is believed to have occurred between Sept. 14 and Oct. 6. The former employee was fired after taking 47 patient files home, which were later returned, according to police Capt. Tony Hamrick. Officials said the former employee has provided no explanation for taking the files home. Detectives conferred with prosecutors and determined that no crime had been committed. Hospital representatives said the breach was not brought to light by patients or anyone else outside the health system. “We discovered it on our own and immediately took action on this employee,” said Tracie Blackmon, director of Public Relations & Marketing for the health system. “We feel confident we took the correct action once we found out about this, and that’s what’s most important — that our patients are taken care of and protected.” The patient information at issue was obtained during the registration process at Premier Imaging, which provides mammograms, ultrasound, X-rays and related services in the Premier Medical Plaza facility off W. Wendover Avenue. The health system is notifying the individuals whose information may have been acquired. The hospital is partnering with an identity protection service to assist patients with preventing and detecting identity fraud. The health system has taken steps to prevent another breach, including a full review of the process of obtaining patient information at Premier Imaging. “Premier Imaging has stringent policies, procedures and systems in place to protect patient information and takes very seriously our obligation to safeguard the personal and health information of our patients,” said Greg Taylor, chief operating officer. “We regret this incident has occurred and are committed to preventing future occurrences.”",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,3.0,47.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The vulnerability was discovered during routine security screening procedures on Sept 29. HCH identified information such as patient names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, health insurance details, diagnoses and treatments were all potentially accessible and were not protected by the company’s firewall. Immediate action was taken and new firewalls were installed to correct the issue and the data has now been made secure and there is believed to be no further risk of exposure. The hospital hired a forensic investigation company to assess the extent of the data breach and the investigation found no evidence that any information had been accessed, even though the data was freely accessible via the internet. Hospital president, Craig James, does not believe the incident can be classed as a HIPAA breach because no data was viewed during the period in which it was potentially accessible. Patients were being notified of the outside possibility that their data had been viewed out of an abundance of caution. The incident has prompted the hospital to contact its business associates and has communicated that the privacy and security of data must be maintained. According to James, “We take our responsibility to protect patient information very seriously and want to reassure you that safeguarding confidential information remains a priority for us.” The security breach has not resulted in the termination of the contract with TruBridge, which will be continuing with the project it has been assigned as HCH advised the public that the company had been very cooperative in the investigation. The hospital plans to convert all of its IT systems over the course of the next 12 months now the company is under the Mission Health System, although it is currently undecided whether TruBridge will play a role in those plans.",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,90.0,25000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

On Feb. 25, 2016, Wyoming Medical Center discovered that an unauthorized third party had access to two organizational email accounts.  No evidence exists to indicate that PHI was viewed or copied from the compromised email accounts. Because the unauthorized party only had access to the email accounts for 15 minutes, we believe that no PHI was viewed or acquired. If the unauthorized party did view patient information, they would have had access to view patient names, medical record numbers, account numbers, dates of hospital service, dates of birth and limited medical information. Wyoming Medical Center took immediate steps to secure the email accounts. Although this is a serious breach, the information potentially disclosed did not include patients’ addresses, Social Security Numbers or insurance information.

2013,Hospital for Special Surgery,NY,INSD,Other,"On November 15, I reported on some updates to HHS’s breach tool. One of the entries I wrote was:
 
 The Hospital for Special Surgery in New York reported that 537 patients had PHI stolen on March 19, although it’s not clear from HHS’s log whether the data were stolen from a computer or if the computer itself was stolen. There was also reference to “paper” format. I could find nothing on their site to clarify the breach and emailed HSS yesterday to request a copy of their substitute notice or press release on the incident. I’ll update this if/when I get a response.
 
 HSS never responded to my request, but today I finally found what I think may explain that entry.
 
 According to a letter sent by their attorneys on October 23 to the Maryland Attorney General’s Office: on May 31, HSS was contacted by the District Attorney’s Office in NY and informed that American Express had contacted the D.A.’s office to advise that credit card information in HSS’s possession appeared to have been accessed and misused to make purchases online. The D.A. asked HSS not to investigate nor notify anyone so as not to interfere with their criminal investigation, and HSS complied. An employee was subsequently arrested in August and charged with multiple counts of grand larceny and identity theft.
 
 With the permission of the D.A. to now investigate and notify, HSS began its own investigation on August 23. Their investigation was time-consuming, as it included examination of each patient’s paper file. Although their investigation was still ongoing as of the time of their October 23 letter to Maryland, HSS believed that the employee might have accessed names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, passport numbers, driver’s license numbers, treating physician’s name, diagnosis, medical billing/treatment code information, bank account and routing number, credit card number with expiration date and security code, insurance company name and policy number, responsible party payment name, and responsible party payment information. Not all patients had all types of information involved.

 On May 1, 2018, Hunt learned that an unauthorized user accessed its Home Health email system through the email account of an employee of Hunt Regional Home Health and sent an email to certain internal users of Hunt’s email system. Although email did not contain any patient protected health information, Hunt was unable to definitively rule out whether the unauthorized user otherwise accessed protected health information while in the system. By having access to the email system, it is possible that the unauthorized user could have had access to personal information of Hunt’s Home Health patients whose information was accessible by the Hunt employee whose email account was compromised. Hunt has reported this incident to the FBI and will fully cooperate with its investigation.
 
 Hunt recently sent letters to those patients who may have been affected by this incident. Although there is no evidence indicating that patients are at risk for identity theft, the letters informed those patients that Hunt is offering them identity theft protection services through ID Experts® to provide them with MyIDCareTM. MyIDCare services include: Twelve months of credit monitoring, a $1,000,000 insurance reimbursement policy, exclusive educational materials, and fully managed ID theft recovery services. More information can be found in the letters provided to those patients who may have been affected.
 
 A variety of administrative, physical, and technical security measures were in place prior to this incident.

2019,Hunt Regional Medical Center,TX,HACK,Network Server,"The Hunt Memorial Hospital District released an update regarding a criminal cyber attack which was discovered against the district earlier this year, warning more of the district’s patients may have been impacted.
 
 “Our cyber security firm has determined the breach was more widespread than we originally believed,” according to Lisa Hill, the Director, Foundation Development and Marketing Communications for Hunt Regional Healthcare.
 
 The information was released in a letter mailed this week to those who may have been affected by the data breach. The letter was distributed to all of the patients potentially targeted by the attack.
 
 When contacted Friday afternoon, Hill did not know exactly how many people were directly affected, but said the decision was reached to contact as many people as possible.
 
 “We decided to send the information to our entire patient database,” Hill said.
 
 Word of the new letter came to light, as the Herald-Banner began being contacted by local residents who had received the notice.
 
 More than 150 posts about the letter were sent to the newspaper’s Facebook page as of noon Friday.
 
 “There were 3 in our mailbox” said Charlotte Davis.
 
 “I got 2 letters and I haven't been a patient there since 1975,” added Billy Ishmael.
 
 “My husband and myself received letters but so did my father and he’s been deceased over 10 years,” said Kim Berry Digby.
 
 Initial word of the data breach came in May, as the district issued a press release indicating it began notifying patients on July 12.
 
 According to the release, the cyber attack occurred in May 2018 “during which hackers gained access to information in its computer network that included personal information of a subset of Hunt’s patients.”
 
 The hackers were able to access medical records which contained information including patients’ names, telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, race and religious preferences.
 
 The letter released this week indicates the district learned on Aug. 14 that the recipient of each letter’s personal information may have been compromised in a cyber attack.
 
 The letter refers back to the May 14 announcement and said it involved “only a subset of our patients, which did not include you.”
 
 Independent cyber forensics experts were employed by the district.
 
 “During this investigation, we determined that your information was also accessible,” according to the letter.
 
 The district said in the letter that it is working with the FBI and cyber security professionals to further investigate the incident “and based on their review, we believe the hackers are no longer in our computer system.”",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,59.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2012,Huntsville Hospital,AL,PORT,Other,"HUNTSVILLE, Alabama - In a scene that could have come out of a heist film, someone entered Huntsville Hospital last week, impersonated a vendor and left with two barrels of old X-rays.
 
 A report filed with Huntsville police said that two 55-gallon barrels containing up to 1,000 patient information microfilms were stolen at 1:06 p.m. on March 7.
 
 But the crime wasn't about identity theft, officials say. Instead, hospital officials think the thieves plan to melt the X-rays to extract the silver in them.
 
 The X-ray films did not contain sensitive medical records, hospital spokeswoman Cheryl Davis said Wednesday afternoon. The X-rays contained only the patient's name, date of birth and medical record number, she said.
 
 The X-rays belonged to between 125 to 175 patients, Davis said. Those patients had multiple X-ray shots to help account for 1,000 X-rays on the police report. Some of the X-rays in the barrels also could have been blank or black, she said.
 
 Huntsville Hospital's biggest concern about the episode may be the security breach that allowed someone posing as a vendor to come into the hospital and take away the barrels.
 
 The barrels were waiting to be collected by a vendor that the hospital pays to dispose of them, said Davis, when the barrels were taken by someone posing as a vendor.
 
 The hospital is reviewing its policies and procedures to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again, Davis said.
 
 Hospital security workers and the police are investigating, she said. The hospital was able to give police the license plate number on the vehicle that the barrels were put in, Davis said.
 
 ""We're still looking for the thieves,"" she said.
 
 The stolen X-rays could be worth up to $1,200 in extracted silver, Andrew Thornton, who is director of sales for a New Hampshire medical recycling firm, said Wednesday afternoon.
 
 If nearly full, the two barrels stolen from Huntsville Hospital could contain about 500 pounds of X-rays, said Thornton, who is with B&D Associates of Concord, N.H. At $32 an ounce, the silver in the 500 pounds of X-rays could yield between $1,000 and $1,200 for the thieves, he said.
 
 The theft of used X-rays from hospitals and other facilities for the purpose of extracting the silver is becoming more common, according to recent news reports.
 
 A Toronto, Canada, man was charged with fraud in Ottawa after nearly 30,000 X-rays were stolen from hospitals and clinics across Ontario province, CTV Ottawa reported last week.
 
 The man posed as an employee of a recycling firm that picks up used X-rays, the station reported. Police think the man began stealing X-rays in Toronto before expanding into other areas, the station reported.
 
 The Lowell Sun of Lowell, Mass., reported last week that two Florida men were charged with stealing a 50-pound barrel of used X-rays from Lowell General Hospital.
 
 The two men were also charged with stealing a barrel of used X-rays from Anna Jaques Hospital in Newburyport, Mass., the newspaper reported.
 
 A YouTube video by DocuVault shows the process of extracting silver from used X-rays. First, the X-rays are shredded twice, then those shreds are washed and dried. The pieces are next pressed through a filter and then pressed into silver flakes and smelted.

 Life Flight informs patients of possible confidential information breach

 SALT LAKE CITY — Patients flown by Life Flight helicopters during at least three months of 2004 were advised Friday that their personal information may have been compromised.
 
 The information, collected from patients in April, May and June of that year, was inadvertently put on an employee website where it may have been accessed by individuals outside of the emergency transport company.
 
 Officials called the isolated situation a ""human error,"" the first of its kind in Life Flight's 35-year history.
 
 ""We take very seriously our responsibility to protect patient information and offer our sincere apology,"" said Bill Butts, director of aviation operations for Life Flight. ""We've looked into this and have taken steps to prevent this from ever happening again.""
 
 Online access to the information, which is believed to contain Social Security numbers for 107 of the 842 patients transported during that time, is no longer available online, as all files have been moved behind a secure firewall, Butts said.
 
 Birth dates, brief medical information and the city of residence were listed for most patients and should have been protected by a password. The simple protection turned out to be less than adequate.
 
 There is no evidence that any of the information made available has been used inappropriately, but Life Flight is taking steps to provide identity protection for any patient flown during that period of time.
 
 Life Flight has sent letters to patients to notify them of the issue and is offering a year of monitoring service. Former patients who receive the letter and have questions may call 1-877-615-3740 for more information.

 Indiana Regional Medical Center in Pennsylvania reported that 1388 patients were notified of a September 28, 2010 incident involving the theft of paper records. The incident had been reported in the media earlier this month. The Indiana Gazette reported:
 
 Indiana Regional Medical Center has put more than 500 patients on notice that hospital records pertaining to them may have been compromised. However, patients’ personal information is not at risk, the hospital said.
 
 Hospital spokesman Mark Richards said most of the records were a variety of paperwork reporting what he called “benign” administrative information produced on a day-to-day basis, such as bed rosters. In three or four instances, though, the records included some medical information — but not detailed medical histories — about patients, he said.
 
 But he said the information was not intended to be used for illegal purposes. “It’s nothing anyone should be concerned about,” he said.
 
 The hospital said a former employee took the records when she left the hospital in September 2010 and had planned to use them as evidence in a legal dispute with a physician.

 Notice on Possible Patient Record Breach
 
 September 9, 2011
 INDIANAPOLIS — On September 2, the Indiana University School of Medicine began sending letters to 3,192 individuals that the theft of a password-protected, computer laptop may have compromised their confidential patient information. The laptop, belonging to a physician in the school’s Department of Surgery, contained information, such as name, age, sex, diagnosis, medical record number, and in 178 instances, the individual’s Social Security number. The information was being used for research purposes.Although the laptop computer was password protected, there is a possibility that the information could be accessed by a computer specialist with enough time and resources.
 
 The disappearance of the laptop, apparently stolen from the physician’s vehicle on Tuesday, August 16, 2011, was immediately reported to law enforcement.
 
 The IU School of Medicine is providing detailed information to those who might be affected by this incident at medicine.iu.edu/research/media-alert-faqs/, including suggestions how affected individuals may protect themselves from the possible unauthorized use of their personal information.
 
 The IU School of Medicine and the IU Department of Surgery deeply regret this incident and are taking steps and security measures to minimize the likelihood of future incidents.
 
 So why wasn’t IU informed of the theft until more than two weeks later? That’s not good.
 
 According to the FAQ’s on the breach, the laptop held data on some patients going back to 1980, not all of whom may have been directly asked to permit their data to be used for research purposes. I do not mention this to suggest that IU did anything illegal, but merely to note that some people may never have consented to the researcher having their name and other information.
 
 IU acknowledged that errors were made:
 
 … the computer laptop was password protected and stored behind a locked door – but it should have been stored using “encryption,” a process that makes it extremely difficult for a third person to see and/or the information should have been “de-identified,” a process that removes any way to link it to an individual.
 
 While acknowledging that errors were made, I note that IU did not offer those affected any free credit monitoring services – even, apparently, the 178 individuals whose SSN were involved.

 Muncie-based Indiana University Health Ball Memorial Hospital is notifying some of its patients after a bag containing billing paperwork with patient information was found at an intersection in Muncie, according to a notice on the organization's website.
 
 The bag was discovered Sept. 26 and IU Health retrieved it within hours. It contained paperwork with patient names, physicians’ names, birthdays, genders, medical record numbers, dates and times of service, diagnoses and procedures. However, no medical records, financial information or social security numbers were included.

2013,Indiana University Health Arnett,IN,Theft,Laptop,"Indiana University Health notifies patients of data breach
 
 May 13, 2013 - There was yet another unencrypted laptop theft in April, as Indiana University Health Arnett, Inc. told 10,300 affected patients of the health data breach via letter on May 10.
 
 The laptop was in an employee’s car and may have contained patient names, dates of birth, physicians’ names, medical record numbers, diagnoses and dates of service. But Arnett’s press release indicates that Social Security numbers, financial information or patients’ medical records were not included on the device.
 
 Arnett said in a statement that the month-long delay was caused by an investigation of who was included in the breach and the data involved as part of cooperation with the White County Sheriff’s Office. As is the case with most of these types of breaches, Arnett claims that it doesn’t believe any data has been misused or accessed with malicious intent, but the laptop still hasn’t been found.
 
 We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. Arnett takes very seriously its obligation to keep the information it maintains secure and we appreciate the trust that you place in us. Arnett is reviewing its policies and procedures to minimize the chance of such an incident occurring in the future. In addition, Arnett has mandatory privacy and security training for all of its workforce members.
 
 While it’s still unclear as to why it took a month for Arnett to tell patients of the breach, once again it would be helpful if the organization explained how exactly it will improve its privacy training practices. Does that involve a PowerPoint (hopefully) not or more extensive, hands-on training that encompasses all types of patient privacy risk? It seems as though the breach could have been avoided by simply encrypting the device so that even when human error is involved, no data is compromised. Answers to questions such as whether staff will know what has and hasn’t been encrypted going forward would give insight to what Arnett is doing to progress training.",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,10300.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
2016,Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital,IN,PORT,Other,"Indiana University Health’s Arnett Hospital has alerted 29,324 patients about the potential exposure of their Protected Health Information after an unencrypted flash drive disappeared from its emergency department.
 
 The flash drive was discovered to be missing on November 20, 2015, and an investigation was immediately launched. Efforts are continuing to try to locate the missing flash drive, which was lost in an area of the hospital not accessible to the public. Consequently, hospital officials do not believe patient data have been acquired or viewed by an external third party.
 
 IU Health Arnett Hospital started sending breach notification letters to affected patients last week to inform them that some of their PHI has potentially been compromised. However, no reports of inappropriate use of the data have so far been received by the hospital.
 
 The flash drive was not used to store Social Security numbers, financial information, or credit card numbers, although spreadsheets saved on the device included patient names, medical record numbers, dates of birth, and medical diagnoses.
 
 Norma Gilbert, director of quality and clinical excellence for IU Health Arnett, issued a statement confirming “Patient medical record information is kept on a secure server… This is not the standard method of storing patient data.”
 
 As a result of the security breach IU Health Arnett will be reviewing its security policies and will take steps to reduce the probability of incidents such as this from occurring again in the future.
 
 A Bad Start to 2016 After ‘The Year of the Healthcare Data Breach’
 
 
 2015 was a bad year for the healthcare industry. Well over twice the number of healthcare records were exposed in the past 12 months than were exposed between 2009 and the end of 2014.
 
 The Indiana University Health security incident is the largest suffered since OH Muhlenberg’s reported its 84,681-patient record hacking incident in November, 2015.
 
 The latest security incident is the ninth largest to be suffered by a HIPAA-covered entity in the past 6 months, with only the security incidents at Molina Healthcare, OH Muhlenberg, Excellus Health Plan, Empi Inc, North East Medical Services, Medical Informatics Engineering, UCLA Health and Lancaster County EMS having exposed more records.
 
 OCR Fines for Loss and Theft of Unencrypted Portable Storage Devices
 
 
 Portable devices used to store healthcare data can be easily misplaced, lost, or stolen. It is therefore essential that data stored on the devices are encrypted. Failure to use encryption on portable devices can easily result in an OCR HIPAA breach fine.
 
 In November 2015, Lahey Hospital and Medical Center settled with OCR for $850,000 after a laptop computer was stolen, exposing the records of 599 patients.
 
 Alaska Department of Health and Human Services settled with OCR for $1.7 million last year after a portable electronic storage device was stolen from the vehicle of a DHHS employee.
 
 In 2014, Stanford Hospital & Clinics agreed to a $4.1 million settlement after 1 million records were exposed when two laptop computers were stolen, and a $1.7 million fine was paid by Concentra Health Services after an unencrypted laptop computer was stolen.

 Indianapolis, Ind. — The Indiana University School of Medicine has identified an additional 818 individuals whose patient information was contained in a binder left in a car stolen in September.
 
 Police have recovered the vehicle along with the binder. Analysis of the contents of the binder identified an additional 818 individuals’ information. An initial reconstruction of the binder data revealed information for 1,431 patients. Of the 818, five individuals’ original Medicare Beneficiary number, which includes a Social Security number, were identified.
 
 The Indiana University School of Medicine began notifying the additional affected patients on Dec. 14, and is providing call center support to answer patient questions. To help prevent a future incident, the Indiana University School of Medicine is actively reviewing its policies and procedures on handling critical data, providing additional training to the division and defining alternative, secure means for making the information available to internal staff with a need to know.
 
 Affected individuals may wish to periodically request a free credit report and/or place a credit freeze to ensure accounts have not been activated without their knowledge. For additional questions contact us at 1-877-418-8085.

2018,Inova Health System,VA,Theft,Electronic Medical Record,"Inova Health has been notifying patients of a breach that law enforcement first alerted them to on September 5.
 
 According to a notice on the Northern Virginia – Washington, D.C. – metro area health system’s site:
 
 On September 5, 2018, we were advised by law enforcement that some of our patient records may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. Upon learning this, we immediately began an investigation to determine how the access occurred and engaged a leading forensic firm to determine what happened and what information may have been accessed. Our investigation determined that the unauthorized person obtained the login credentials of an Inova employee and used those credentials to access our billing system in January 2017 and between July and October 2017. The individual also accessed a limited number of paper billing records in December of 2016. The individual accessed certain patients’ information, including patient names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, and Social Security numbers. For a small number of patients, treatment information also may have been accessed.
 
 In response to the incident, and in addition to offering free credit monitoring and identity protection services, Inova writes that they deeply regret the incident and are
 
 enhancing our security processes, have put in place additional monitoring tools, are retraining employees about password security and securing sensitive information before leaving their desks unattended, have updated our policies regarding password complexity and limitations on transmission of information, and we are reviewing our policies and procedures.
 
 Hopefully they are also going to be imposing stricter and more frequent password reset policies, as if the bad actor could access the billing system in January 2017 as well as July – October of 2017, it tells us that the employee did not change their password during that time period and the system did not require the employee to change their password.
 
 DataBreaches.net called and emailed Inova yesterday to request clarification on a few points, including the number of patients affected or notified, and how the unauthorized individual was able to access paper records in 2016 — were they an employee or was there some other way in which they gained access?
 
 DataBreaches.net received a pro forma response about the incident that did not answer either of the questions above, despite a second request. If Inova does answer those questions, this post will be updated.
 
 UPDATE 1: I heard back from Inova after publication of this post. It seems that the unauthorized individual is alleged to be a former independent contractor. According to Inova’s spokesperson, his last day with Inova was in November of 2017. Their spokesperson adds,
 
 We cannot provide specific information about the individual responsible, except that we are working with law enforcement in their on-going investigation. Inova serves more than two million patients each year and only a small percentage of that patient population was affected. Inova values its relationship with our patients and understands the importance of protecting patients’ information.
 
 So maybe their password reset policies were adequate but the contractor’s access made those policies and passwords ineffective as a defense.
 
 UPDATE 2: The incident now appears on HHS’s breach tool as impacting 12,331 patients.

2014,Inspira Health Network INC,NJ,Theft,Desktop Computer,"The theft of two personal computers from Inspira Health Network’s Vineland Medical Center in December 2013 has potentially exposed health data of 1,411 New Jersey patients. All affected individuals are in the process of being notified that some of their data has potentially been compromised, although the risk to individuals is considered to be low.
 
 In December, 2013, a former employee at the Vineland center took two computers from storage facilities in the center’s radiology department. The filing room where the computers were being stored was unlocked and unsecured. Christopher McCourt of Port Norris took the computers and sold them to a local recycling center.
 
 The computers, reportedly worth $2,800 each, were sold for just $14. According to a Vineland Police Department statement, McCourt committed the crime to obtain gas money. This was not the first time McCourt had taken a computer. He also admitted to another theft, although the incident had gone unreported. McCourt has now been charged with burglary and theft and is being held in Cumberland County Jail.
 
 Inspira Health was able to recover the computers and has reported that no patient data was compromised as the computers did not contain any hard drives. While this is good news for its patients, it has since emerged that the hard drives had been disposed of prior to the sale of the computers and the whereabouts of those hard drives is currently unknown.
 
 Inspira took the decision to notify 1,411 of its patients that their data may have been compromised after an investigation determined that some health information could have been stored on the hard drives. Inspira was unable to determine if this was definitely the case, although an analysis of a similar computer revealed that limited patient data could have been exposed which included X-rays, dates of the provision of medical services, patient’s names, addresses, dates of birth and some Social Security numbers.
 
 According to a statement from Inspira Healthcare, “any patient information potentially stored on the computer would have been very difficult to access due to the digital security systems used by the health network.”
 
 Breach notification letters were sent to patients as a precautionary measure and all individuals affected have been offered a year of free credit monitoring services. They have also been advised to closely monitor their credit reports for any sign or fraudulent activity.
 
 The data breach was swiftly identified and resolved, and the threat of identity/medical theft is low. However, the incident raises a number of questions about security at the hospital; such as how an employee was able to walk out of the facilities carrying two PCs without being noticed and why the computers were stored in an unlocked room.
 
 HIPAA requires all covered entities to implement the appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect patient data and failing to secure the storage room suggests there has been a violation of HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,1411.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2016,Integrity Transitional Hospital,TX,HACK,Network Server,"Integrity Transitional Hospital of Denton, TX has discovered an unauthorized individual gained access to its computer system and potentially viewed lab test results and other sensitive patient data. The security breach affects patients of a number of different healthcare providers.
 
 The security breach was discovered when suspicious activity was detected on its network on August 15, 2016. Access to the system was rapidly shut down and a third party computer forensics firm was hired to conduct a thorough analysis of its systems to determine whether any protected health information had been accessed or copied.
 
 Integrity Transitional Hospital receives laboratory specimens from a number of companies working on behalf of healthcare providers and submits those specimens to laboratories for testing. The investigation revealed a system used to store data relating to those services and billing was compromised and the protected health information of patients could potentially have been viewed. While data access was possible, no reports of data misuse have been received by the hospital in the two months since the breach was detected.
 
 A range of patient data were stored in the system including names, laboratory test results and other testing information, health insurance details, and scanned driver’s licenses. No Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or financial information were compromised.
 
 Patients were notified of the privacy breach by mail on October 14 and have been offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for a period of one year without charge. Patients have been advised to exercise caution and remain vigilant to the possibility of fraud and identity theft.
 
 The data breach has prompted Integrity Transitional Hospital to conduct a full security review. Additional data security measures will now be implemented to ensure that all laboratory information held by the hospital is better protected in the future.

The CE provided hack notification to HHS, the media, and affected individuals. Individual notification included a toll-free number and the Harris County District Attorney’s contact number. Following OCR’s investigation, the CE improved safeguards by upgrading its system to allow for more specific monitoring of the activity of users and creating user codes to track copier use.

 Those patients whose personal information was accessed have been notified and offered free credit card fraud protection. JMH said they took quick action to address the issue and the employees have been released from their jobs at JMH. Officials have launched an internal investigation.
 
 Source: WSVN.
 
 I do not find any statement on the hospital’s web site at the time of this posting and the incident has not yet appeared on HHS’s breach tool, although I imagine it will.
 
 In the absence of actual information from the hospital, I might speculate that the employees were snooping into the records of Sean Kingston who was hospitalized there recently after a jet ski accident, but that, of course, is just idle speculation.
 
 Update: Ah, speculation was wrong. The Miami Herald is reporting:
 
 Jackson Health System reported Monday it is cooperating with police in an investigation of an employee who “apparently inappropriately accessed confidential patient information” of 1,800 people, the system announced in a press release.
 
 Jackson said the 1,800 patients have been notified and offered free credit card fraud protection.

2015,Jacobi Medical Center,NY,Unauthorized Disclosure,Email,"The New York City Health & Hospitals Corporation’s (HHC) Jacobi Medical Center has reported 90,060 patient records have been compromised when an employee copied the data from the company’s system and emailed it to her personal email account; as well as copying her new employer on the email.
 
 The employee sent the information before leaving her employment at the HHC Jacobi Medical Center to work for another healthcare provider. The data contained detailed information about the patients which included their names, addresses, contact telephone numbers, medical record numbers, health insurance information, treatment dates and the category of services they received at the hospital. Some Social Security numbers were also present in the data.
 
 However, the Medical Center’s quick response is believed to have prevented the data from being viewed by any other individual, although the possibility cannot be entirely eliminated. The Jacobi Medical Center’s data network is monitored automatically for communications sent containing Protected Health Information (PHI) and the incident was quickly discovered.
 
 According to a statement issued by the hospital on April, 28, “PHI has been deleted from all known unauthorized sites and sources to which it was sent and there is no basis to believe that it was forwarded to any other site before it was deleted.”
 
 Patients Advised to Take Steps to Protect Against Fraud
 The risk to patients is perceived to be low; however it is important that patients take all data exposure seriously, even when there is only a small chance that information has been viewed by unauthorized individuals.
 
 Insurance information, Social Security numbers and Personally Identifiable Information (PAA) was included in the exposed data; everything an identity thief needs to obtain loans and credit cards, make false insurance claims and commit medical fraud.
 
 Because a risk does exist and the potential damage caused can be considerable, HHC is offering all affected patients free credit monitoring and identity protection services for a period of one year with ID Experts.
 
 Breach Triggers Improvements to Data Security
 HHC hospitals are protected by multi-layered cybersecurity systems and communications are monitored; however this security breach shows that no organization is immune, especially from insider theft. While the systems detected the breach, in this case they did not block the email from being sent.
 
 The breach has highlighted this vulnerability in the HHC’s security defenses and action is being taken to address the issue. Patients have been informed that the organization is now setting up a new communication blocking system to prevent PHI from being sent to any third party or email account outside of the company’s intranet, except for authorized purposes.

2010,"Jefferson Health , Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals",PA,Theft,Laptop,"Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals has notified approximately 21,000 patients that there was a theft of a laptop computer containing personal information. Affected patients have been sent a letter detailing the extensive identity protection resources being made available to them.
 
 On June 14, 2010, an employee reported to Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals’ security personnel that his password-protected, personal laptop computer was stolen from an office in the hospital. In violation of hospital policy, the computer contained protected health information. Individuals whose records were affected received inpatient care at Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals during a six-month period in 2008. The data included name, birth date, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, social security number, insurance information, hospital account number and other internal and administrative coding. Though the computer was password-protected, it was not hospital-issued and the information was not encrypted. To date, there has been no indication of inappropriate use of the information stored on the stolen computer.
 
 “On behalf of everyone at Jefferson Hospitals, please accept our apologies and know that we are committed to providing assistance to the affected patients,” said Hospitals President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Lewis. “Jefferson Hospitals has extensive internal policies reflecting our commitment to the appropriate use of personal health information and employees receive training on these policies annually. The storage of patient data on an employee’s unencrypted computer – even while on TJUH premises – is a breach of hospitals’ policy.” The requirements under the HIPAA/HITECH statutes and regulations for public disclosure of security breaches of Protected Health Information (“PHI”) have brought to light an increasing volume involving highly respected and sophisticated providers and insurers. It has often encouraged such providers and insurers to go well beyond the minimum legally required responses as a matter of redeeming client relations and public image.
 
 Josh Goldstein wrote in the July 30, 2010 issue of The Philadelphia Inquirer (the “Inquirer”) that a laptop computer with unencrypted PHI on 21,000 patients was stolen from an office at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (“TJUH”) in Philadelphia on June 14, 2010. According to Mr. Goldstein, “[t]he Jefferson records were for every patient admitted to the hospital from March 9 to June 9 and Aug[ust] 1 to November 1, 2008.” Additionally, the security breach was reported to have resulted from the copying of PHI by one employee onto a personal laptop in violation of TJUH policy.
 
 To provide some support for those affected by the PHI breach, the Goldstein article stated that TJUH has offered a free year of identity monitoring, protection and remediation service (“Identity Protection Service”) to the potential victims. This offer of Identity Protection Service by TJUH is similar to proposals made by numerous other providers and insurers that have experienced PHI security breaches in the past. In expressing deep apology for the PHI mishap, TJUH president Thomas J. Lewis was reported to urge those whose PHI may have been compromised to activate the Identity Protection Service as soon as possible. 
 
 As this blog has reported earlier, the public disclosures required by HIPAA/HITECH for security breaches respecting PHI often make providers and insurers vulnerable to embarrassment, criticism and diminished reputation that may actually overshadow the significant legal costs and statutory consequences of the breaches themselves. 
 
 Additionally, TJUH and others that experience PHI breaches are required to report to, and are listed on, a permanent database which is readily accessible online and is operated by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. 
 
 A final intangible but significant concern is that, as was the case in the Goldstein article, other providers in the same geographic region or areas of practice which suffered security breaches of PHI previously will see their past calamities revived as background and comparison for each new reported event. The effect may be repeated publishing of a single past PHI security breach.
 
 To this end, providers and insurers must heighten their efforts to avoid PHI security breaches in the first place. It is clear, however, that even with the policies, policies and precautions instituted by highly respected institutions such as TJUH, the parade of PHI security breaches will continue to lengthen. If such breaches do occur, prompt, decisive and proactive action such as that undertaken by TJUH is required to maximize damage control and rehabilitate relations with clients and the public.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,21000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2011,"Jefferson Health , Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals",PA,Theft,Other,"I’ve occasionally reported news stories concerning the theft of x-ray films containing personally identifiable information. Here’s another example from HHS’s latest update to the breach tool: Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals in Pennsylvania notified 3,150 patients after x-ray films were stolen on September 6. The hospital posted a notice linked from its home page.
 
 A search of HHS’s breach tool reveals that there have been four breach reports concerning stolen x-ray films since September 2009 when mandated reported began, but I’m aware of a number of other such cases that have not (yet?) appeared on the breach tool.
 
 In August, Harvard University Health Services reported the theft of over 1,000 films. An arrest was made in that case two weeks later. The same individual may have been involved from the theft of films from Anna Jacques Hospital, also in Massachusetts. Portsmouth Hospital in New Hampshire was also victimized, although it is not clear whether the same thieves were involved.
 
 In September, Good Samaritan Hospital in Baltimore reported theft of x-ray films, while two hospitals in Pennsylvania other than Thomas Jefferson University also reported such thefts: Grand View Hospital and Lankenau Hospital.
 
 And these thefts may just be the tip of the iceberg.
 
 Old films may contain some personally identifiable information such as names, gender, dates of birth, dates of service, areas X-rayed and medical record numbers. Even though the thefts are generally for the silver and not for the information, entities have felt responsible for disclosing these breaches.
 
 So…. have you increased the security around your discarded x-ray films? If not, consider the cost of breach notifications and the hassles that may ensue and take steps to improve security.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,3150.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The information included: patient name, date of service, medical record number, patient account number, Social Security number, race, insurance carrier, address, phone number, sex, date of birth, patient allergies if any, and initial patient assessment information. We reported the theft to the Louisville Metro Police Department as soon as we became aware of it on July 19 and are continuing to work with the police as they conduct a thorough investigation.
 
 The internal investigation included interviews with team members who work in the vandalized area and the review of video surveillance. The stolen laptops were secured to a desk with a locking device, and were also behind a locked door.
 
 The hospital is committed to safeguarding patients’ sensitive personal information and took immediate steps to fortify the protective measures that were already in place. Efforts have continued to implement encryption software for all laptops, computers/hard drives and all other portable electronic devices.

2014,Jewish Hospital,KY,Other,Email,"Description
 A small number of employees of the covered entity (CE), Jewish Hospital, responded to “phishing” emails that appeared legitimate and disclosed the demographic and clinical protected health information (PHI) of approximately 2,992 individuals. The PHI involved in the breach included names, addresses, birthdates, diagnoses, treatments received, health insurance information and the social security numbers of a few individuals. In response to the incident, the CE secured the affected email accounts and arranged for a forensic investigation. While the CE has no evidence that the electronic PHI in the employees’ mailboxes was accessed or otherwise infiltrated by the phishing scheme, it nonetheless sent breach notification letters and offered one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to all potentially affected individuals. It also provided breach notification to HHS and the media and provided substitute notice. Following the breach, the CE deployed anti-phishing software, accelerated its employee phishing education campaign, established a quick reaction team for proactively blocking phishing or other web-based threats, and enhanced its auditing and logging controls. OCR obtained assurances that the corrective actions listed above were completed.

2010,John Muir Physician Network,CA,PORT,Other,"John Muir Health, the Walnut Creek-based hospital system, said Monday it has begun notifying 5,450 patients by mail of a “potential breach of their personal and health information.”
 
 The move came after the theft two months ago of two laptop computers at the John Muir Physician Network Perinatal office in Walnut Creek, officials said April 5.
 
 “The laptops were password protected and contained data in a format that would not be readily accessible. While we have no evidence that the information has been accessed or used inappropriately, we cannot rule out that possibility, and, therefore, are notifying patients to help protect their identity,” said Hala Helm, Muir’s vice president and chief compliance and privacy officer.
 
 “We apologize for any inconvenience or anxiety this incident may cause our patients,” Helm said in the statement. “We take this issue very seriously and are committed to protecting the personal and health information of our patients.”
 
 In addition to the Walnut Creek Police Department, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been notified of the theft and possible privacy breach. John Muir Health said it is continuing to cooperate with the investigation.
 
 After discovering the theft, officials notified the Walnut Creek police and “conducted a thorough internal investigation to determine what information was stored on the laptops, whether the information could potentially be accessed and, if so, who was potentially affected.”
 
 External vendors and internal experts discovered that the missing laptops contained personal and health information going back more than three years.
 
 Officials say they initiated the notification process as soon as they knew what information was stored on the missing laptops and which patients were affected. “We wanted to make sure we had accurate information and could address questions from our patients,” Helm said.
 
 Although officials still hope the laptops will be found, they say it’s their responsibility “to help our patients protect themselves from the potential of identity theft and fraud.”
 
 As a result, Muir is recommending that affected patients place a fraud alert on their credit files. The notification letter has details on how to do this, and the hospital system says it has arranged with Equifax to provide identity theft protection for those patients “at no cost to them for one year.”
 
 Although John Muir officials say they believe reasonable safeguards were in place, including a locked and guarded building and password-protected laptops, they have since implemented additional security measures, “including data encryption software, as a result of this incident,” Helm said. “Patient information stored on laptops at the Perinatal office is now encrypted, and the laptops are locked down. Encryption software is also being installed on John Muir Health laptops throughout the organization.”
 
 The breach is the latest to occur in the Bay Area and Northern California, following similar incidents at UC San Francisco and Kaiser Permanente. But the problem is national in scope, and similar data breaches have occurred coast to coast.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,5450.0,545000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2010,University of Texas Medical Branch,TX,INSD,Other,"Confidential information about 1,200 UTMB patients may have been stolen last year.
 
 The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston mailed letters Tuesday to patients whose private information was accessed by an employee of MedAssets, a company hired to assist with billing third-party payers.
 
 Individual records included the patients' names, addresses, Social Security numbers, insurance information, medical facilities where services had been received and, for a small group, additional medical details.
 
 “Whether she did anything with it is a different issue,” said Carolee King, UTMB's vice president for legal and regulatory affairs. “We don't know at this time that anybody suffered any ill consequences from this.” The Georgia-based contractor employed the woman between July and October.
 
 Ex-employee arrested
 In December, law enforcement officials notified the company that former employee Katina Rochelle Candrick had been arrested and charged with identity theft. She is accused of using a stolen identity to gain employment at MedAssets.
 
 None of the charges so far relates to information Candrick may have obtained as a MedAssets employee.
 
 UTMB officials were informed about the incident on Jan. 21 and have been working with the Texas Department of Public Safety and MedAssets since then, King said.
 
 The letters offered the affected patients identity theft protection, paid for by Med-Assets, as well as guidance about obtaining free copies of credit reports and placing fraud alerts on credit files. Patients also were given contact information for law enforcement officers investigating the case.
 
 “We place a priority on our patients' privacy, and we sincerely regret this incident,” King said in a statement. “We have reviewed our policies and processes related to vendor access to our systems closely and have enhanced them.”
 
 UTMB no longer uses Med-Assets as a contractor for third-party collection services because the short-term agreement ended last fall, King wrote in an e-mail.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,1200.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2007,Johns Hopkins Hospital,MD,STAT,Other,"When he saw weekend news reports that a computer containing the personal records of 5,783 cancer patients had been stolen from Johns Hopkins Hospital, attorney Michael Mastracci knew exactly where to find it.
 
 ""I knew about it weeks ago,"" he said of the computer. ""Before I saw the news, I didn't know what was on the computer. But when I saw the stories, I knew immediately that that was the computer I'd heard about. ""
 
 By early Sunday afternoon, he had arranged to have the computer brought to his Catonsville law office. He called The Sun, which had reported the theft Saturday, to find out whom to contact at Hopkins to return the hottest desktop in town.
 
 ""I have access to that computer, and I can put it in the university's hands,"" Mastracci told a reporter. ""I am anxious to return it to those souls who feel violated.""
 
 Hopkins officials reclaimed the computer that afternoon. Yesterday, they confirmed that it was the machine they were looking for and that none of the patients' personal records appeared to have been accessed for use in identity theft.
 
 Mastracci said he first learned of the missing computer three weeks after it was stolen July 15 from an administrative building on Hopkins' main campus.
 
 A person whom Mastracci declined to name, based on attorney-client privilege, contacted him for legal advice on returning the missing computer to Hopkins.
 
 ""It was not stolen with the knowledge that there was a big patient database on it and that that could be sold for money,"" Mastracci said.
 
 Mastracci met with the person who contacted him, recommending that the computer be returned as quickly as possible. Initially, the lawyer said, the plan was to have a private investigation firm return the machine on behalf of his client. But the client needed time to raise money to pay the firm.
 
 Meanwhile, Hopkins security officials and city police were searching for the missing computer.
 
 Hopkins officials completed a police report Aug. 2 and sent out letters Aug. 24 notifying the patients and their families of the security breach. The letter said their Social Security numbers, birth dates, medical histories and other personal information were on the missing desktop.
 
 The patients' records were part of a tumor registry database required by state law. The computer was password protected, but the records were not encrypted or password protected.
 
 Based on video surveillance records, a Hopkins employee and the employee of an on-site vendor were implicated in the theft and issued criminal summonses, according to Hopkins officials. Baltimore police were unable to provide details yesterday about the identities of the people suspected in the theft.
 
 Upon learning from news reports that the computer was the latest in a string of high-profile cases of people's personal data gone astray, Mastracci realized the stakes were higher than he had thought.
 
 ""I realized it was time to move, and I had to make a quick decision to move on it,"" he said. ""I contacted [The Sun] because I knew you had been in contact with Johns Hopkins.""
 
 After contacting the paper's newsroom Sunday, Mastracci called Margaret R. Garrett, an attorney in Hopkins' legal affairs department, and informed her he had the computer. A Hopkins security officer arrived about 4 p.m. that day to retrieve the desktop.
 
 Preliminary findings ""strongly suggest"" that the computer was never turned on while it was missing and that no one gained access to the database on its hard drive, according to a statement by Joann Rodgers, a Hopkins spokeswoman.
 
 Hopkins plans to have an independent specialist in information technology search further for any evidence of an information breach. The hospital also plans to send letters with updated information to patients whose personal information was on the computer.
 
 One of the patients, who asked to remain anonymous because of her condition, said a Hopkins official called her yesterday to tell her the computer had been returned. She was relieved by the news, saying, ""I do feel better.""
 
 Mastracci said Hopkins officials contacted him Monday to thank him for arranging the computer's return. ""I assured them, to the extent that I could be certain, that the data was not stolen as part of any identity theft scheme,"" he said.
 
 Identity theft is becoming so common that he plans to expand his law practice to handle such cases. ""It's going to be huge,"" he said. ""It boggles your mind the ways people can get ripped off.""",1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1.0,0.0,578300.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
2007,"Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins University",MD,PORT,Other,"Johns Hopkins became aware on Jan. 18 that eight backup computer tapes containing sensitive personal information on about 52,000 university employees had not been returned as expected by a contractor that routinely makes microfiche backups of such data.
 
 On Jan. 26, as an intensive investigation was under way, it was learned that a ninth tape, containing less sensitive personal information on approximately 83,000 patients at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, had also not been returned as expected from the contractor.
 
 All nine tapes had been sent to the contractor's Baltimore-area facility on Dec. 21. The investigation by both the contractor and Johns Hopkins has determined that the tapes never reached the facility. It also concluded that it is highly likely that the tapes were mistakenly left by a courier company hired by the contractor at another stop. They were thought to be trash, collected and later incinerated.
 
 There is no evidence to indicate that the tapes were stolen or that the data on them has been misused. Johns Hopkins knows of no evidence of identity theft arising from this incident and believes that the risk of any such problems is very, very low.
 
 The information on the university payroll tapes included Social Security numbers and, in some cases, bank account information for present and former employees. This includes retirees and students who have held campus jobs. Employees whose information is on the tapes come from all university units except the Applied Physics Laboratory.
 
 The hospital tape included personal information on all new Johns Hopkins Hospital patients first seen between July 4 and Dec. 18, 2006, or who had changes in their demographic information in that time. The patient information included such data as names and dates of birth. It did not include addresses, Social Security numbers, financial information of any kind, or any medical information.
 
 Letters are being sent to all affected Johns Hopkins University employees, current and former, and to all affected Johns Hopkins Hospital patients, except for those relatively few for whom addresses are unavailable.
 
 Anyone receiving a letter may visit a Web site established to provide additional information. That site is at www.jhu.edu/identityalert. For those without access to the Web, a telephone number has been established at 1-800-981-7524.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,28.0,135000.0,13500000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2009,Johns Hopkins Hospital,MD,INSD,Other,"An employee at Johns Hopkins Hospital stole names, social security numbers and address from patients and provided them to friends who obtained credit from stores to buy more than $600,000 in merchandise, federal authorities allege in an indictment.
 
 The Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office charged the employee, Jasmine Amber Smith, and four others with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and identity theft. The indictment alleges that she stole the information from August 2007 through March 2009. The court papers do not say precisely where Smith worked at the hospital, but it says she add access to personal information from patients and their guardians.
 
 Authorities said at least 50 stores and people were victimized. That includes banks, stores such as Sears, ManoSwartz, Best Buy, Boscov and Toys R Us.
 
 Here is a full statement from the Maryland U.S. Attorney's Office:
 
 A federal grand jury has indicted the following five Maryland defendants on fraud and aggravated identity theft charges in connection with a scheme to use stolen hospital patient identity information to open fraudulent credit accounts and make purchases on ""instant credit"" at retail stores in Maryland:
 
 
  Michael Allen, age 34, of Baltimore,
  Jasmine Amber Smith, age 25, of Nottingham,
  Tyrell Douglas McCormick, age 22, of Baltimore,
  Ayanna Devon Johnson, age 38, of Baltimore, and
  Gloria Canada, age 54, of Baltimore.
 
 
 The superseding indictment was returned on September 15, 2010 and unsealed today upon the arrest of the final defendant, Gloria Canada.
 
 
 The indictment was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein; Special Agent in Charge Barbara Golden of the United States Secret Service – Baltimore Field Office; Postal Inspector in Charge Daniel S. Cortez of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; and Chief James W. Johnson of the Baltimore County Police Department.
 
 
 According to the 39 count superseding indictment, while employed by Johns Hopkins Hospital from August 2007 to March 2009, Smith is alleged to have improperly accessed the records of the hospital's patients to obtain the personal identity information of patients and the parents and guardians of minor patients, including names, social security numbers, dates of birth and addresses. Smith allegedly provided the stolen identity information to Johnson and Canada. From May 2008 to June 2009, Allen and McCormick allegedly used the stolen information to apply for instant credit at stores located in Maryland and make purchases on ""instant credit"" before the fraudulently-obtained credit cards were received by the victims.
 
 
 The indictment alleges that during the course of the scheme, the defendants fraudulently obtained over $600,000 in credit from over 50 institutional and individual victims.
 
 
 The defendants face a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud and two years in prison consecutive to any other sentence for aggravated identity theft. In addition, McCormick and Allen face a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison for bank fraud and 15 years in prison for access device fraud. Canada is scheduled to have her initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Baltimore today at 2:00 p.m.
 
 
 An indictment is not a finding of guilt. An individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.
 
 
 United States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein commended the U.S. Secret Service – Baltimore Field Office, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division and the Baltimore County Police Department for their work in the investigation.

2009,Johns Hopkins Medicine,MD,INSD,Other,"Baltimore, Maryland - U.S. District Judge William D. Quarles, Jr. sentenced Shanell Angelia Bowser, age 30, of Baltimore, today to 5 years in prison, followed by 5 years of supervised release, for stealing the personal identifying information of insurance claimants from her employer to fraudulently obtain credit used to purchase merchandise and obtain cash, announced United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein. Judge Quarles also ordered Bowser to pay $203,627.11 in restitution to the victims of the fraud scheme.
 
 According to Bowser’s plea agreement and other court documents from August 2005 to November 2008, she used her employment as a claims clerk with a medical insurance adjuster to obtain unauthorized access to names, social security numbers and other personal identifying information of client-claimants. Bowser and her co-schemers used this stolen information, as well as personal identifying information taken from patients of a local health care provider and their relatives, to fraudulently apply for credit by telephone or online. Bowser and her co-schemers used the credit to withdraw cash from ATM machines; to purchase clothing, electronics and other items; and for services such as mobile phones, land line phones, internet service and cable/satellite television service.
 
 The online purchases were delivered to the homes of Bowser and her co-schemers, their friends and family, and to vacant homes. Bowser drove around Baltimore City to locate vacant homes to use for delivery addresses. When the goods were shipped to the vacant homes, Bowser would direct others (“runners”) involved in the scheme to go to the vacant homes and bring the packages to Bowser and other co-schemers. Bowser and these co-schemers would take the packages and pay the runners by giving them a fraudulent credit card for their personal use.
 
 Over the course of the three year scheme, Bowser and her co-schemers used stolen identifying information of at least 207 individuals in at least 373 applications for credit accounts from financial institutions. Of those applications, at least 125 fraudulent accounts were opened and used to make purchases in the names of 89 individual victims. Over $200,00 in retail goods and cash advances were purchased and obtained using the fraudulently opened credit accounts.
 
 Co-conspirator Michelle Courtney Johnson, age 31, of Baltimore pleaded guilty to using her employment as a patient services coordinator at Johns Hopkins Medicine to obtain unauthorized access to names, social security numbers and other personal identifying information of over 100 current and former patients of Johns Hopkins. Johnson faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine for conspiracy to commit bank fraud; and a mandatory sentence of two years in prison for aggravated identity theft, consecutive to any term of imprisonment for the conspiracy. U.S. District Judge William D. Quarles, Jr. scheduled sentencing for November 20, 2009, at 11:30 a.m.
 
 United States Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein thanked the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Department of Housing and Urban Development - Office of Inspector General for their investigative work.

2012,"Johns Hopkins Hospital, Highlandtown Community Health Center",MD,INSD,Other,"Another scheme involving insider breaches comes to light in Baltimore. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland reports:
 
 Ringleader Derrick Hill, age 52, and his girlfriend Renee Cabell, age 51, both of Woodlawn, Maryland, pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.
 
 According to their plea agreements, from August to October, 2009, Hill and Cabell conspired with their co-defendants John Coffey and Tawney King to negotiate counterfeit checks drawn on victim bank accounts.
 
 Hill received checks which had been designated for destruction by banks and stolen before they could be destroyed. He also received personal identity information and personal financial information from King who was employed by Highlandtown Community Health Center. According to King’s plea agreement, King accessed patient files and provided Hill with the patient identifying information either directly or through her friend Cabell. Hill used this information to create counterfeit checks using victim’s financial account information and the identity information of other victims. He also obtained counterfeit identification cards and personally altered genuine Maryland driver’s licenses so that they displayed victim identity information but the photograph of one of several co-conspirators, including Coffey.
 
 Hill recruited Coffey to help him cash the checks at banks and retail establishments. If the counterfeit checks were cashed at a retail store, Hill told his co-conspirators what to buy. Proceeds, whether cash or merchandise, were given to Hill, who paid his co-conspirators a small percentage for each successful transaction.
 
 Additionally, Cabell provided Hill with the names and identity information of doctors who applied for fellowships at Johns Hopkins Hospital where Cabell worked, processing the fellowship applications. Hill used the doctors’ identities to rent apartments, buy merchandise and obtain services. Indeed, shortly before Hill’s arrest, Hill was attempting to rent another apartment in a doctor’s identity because he and Cabell were about to be evicted for non-payment on the apartment they rented in the identity of another doctor.
 
 The defendants obtained cash, merchandise and services worth over $188,000. The identities of over 250 individuals were compromised. All four defendants will be required to pay restitution for the full amount of the victims’ losses, which exceeds $188,000.
 
 Hill and the government have agreed that if the Court accepts the plea agreement, Hill will be sentenced to 11 years in prison. U.S. District Judge Richard D. Bennett scheduled his sentencing for March 18, 2013, at 3:00 p.m..
 
 Coffey and King previously pleaded guilty to the same charges. Cabell, Coffey and King face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy and a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years in prison for aggravated identity theft. Judge Bennett scheduled sentencing for Cabell, Coffey and King on March 21, February 13, and February 19, 2013, respectively, all at 3:00 p.m..",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,250.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
2011,Kadlec Regional Medical Center,WA,HACK,Other,"RICHLAND -- Kadlec Regional Medical Center officials announced Wednesday that patients are being notified that one of the hospital's computer servers containing brain scan and other patient studies was hacked in September.
 
 Files housed on the server included information with a patient's name, birth date, age, gender, medical record number and doctor's name, but did not include any patient financial information, address, Social Security number or insurance data.
 
 Kadlec officials first discovered the unauthorized access during routine monitoring of computer network backups Nov. 11, according to a news release.
 
 Kadlec immediately removed the server from service and hired a national company that specializes in computer security to investigate the cause of the incident and scope of the breach.
 
 The analysis confirmed there was unauthorized access to one of Kadlec's 225 servers sometime around Sept. 15. Forensic experts found no evidence that patient data actually was viewed, compromised or removed from the system.
 
 As a precaution, Kadlec is sending a letter to all patients whose information was on the files on the affected server.
 
 ""We take our responsibility to protect patient information very seriously,"" said Rand Wortman, president and CEO of Kadlec Health System. ""This incident was unique, and we apologize for any concern or inconvenience it may cause patients and their families.""
 
 Hospital officials said it has added significant security measures to Kadlec's servers to help prevent future breaches.
 
 ""While it may be impossible to completely thwart skilled and determined hackers from 'parking' on unauthorized servers, we will take all necessary steps to review and strengthen internal procedures to ensure Kadlec provides the highest level of data security possible,"" Wortman said.
 
 Kadlec's notice to patients encouraged them to be vigilant and to notify the hospital immediately if they notice any unusual activity. The hospital is providing all patients whose information was contained in files on the server with identity theft safeguards, officials said.
 
 In addition to contacting affected patients, Kadlec informed the federal Department of Health and Human Services.

2013,Kaiser Foundation Hospital- Orange County,CA,Loss,Other,"December 10, 2013 - No week is complete without a healthcare data breach in which a USB flash drive was either stolen or lost. This time, it was the Kaiser Foundation Hospital Orange County - Anaheim Medical Center alerting patients that their data had been compromised when a flash drive with their information on it went missing.
 
 Update: The Los Angeles Times reports that the September 25 Kaiser Permanente breach affected about 49,000 patients.
 
 The California Attorney General released Kaiser’s letter to patients yesterday, November 25, and explained that patients’ names, medical record numbers, and dates of birth were included on the flash drive, but Social Security numbers were not.
 
 Kaiser didn’t even offer patients the usual year of credit monitoring, which may be considered trite at this point but should be construed as a good-faith effort. Instead, it stated that it respects patients’ rights to file a complaint both with Kaiser and with the Office for Civil Rights. For an organization that still isn’t done with its ongoing, extremely-public legal battle with Surefile, it would be reasonable to expect the organization to do more than say it respects patients’ abilities to complain about their privacy being breached.
 
 Moreover, as PHIPrivacy.net noted, there was little transparency in its notification letter. Kaiser wasn’t forthcoming with information such as whether the data was encrypted and whether it lost or stolen from inside outside the organization. Kaiser isn’t a “mom and pop” shop that isn’t aware of HIPAA and the degree to which patient data safety is federally-regulated. Even if its Anaheim Medical Center is just part of the organization, in comparison to other breached organizations’ responses, some may argue that Kaiser should be able to make a better effort in notifying patients from both risk mitigation and informational standpoints.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2019,Kaiser Permanente,CA,HACK,Email,"Kaiser Permanente said Thursday that a data breach had left personal information on 990 Sacramento-area patients exposed to an unknown and unauthorized individual for about 13 hours.
 “The exposure was identified by an IT security process and corrected immediately upon discovery,” stated Angela B Anderson, Kaiser’s regional compliance director and privacy and security officer for Northern California, in an email sent to The Sacramento Bee. “We do not have any evidence that the information was viewed, used or copied. Kaiser Permanente takes the protection of our member data very seriously.”
 In a letter to Kaiser members, issued Sept. 27, Anderson explained that the unauthorized individual had access to a Sacramento-area provider’s email account, and data in that email account included a combination or some of the following: date or dates of service, age, date of birth, gender, provider name, provider comments, payer name, diagnosis, medical history, benefit information, insurance coverage status, treatment procedure and service provided.
 The patients’ Social Security numbers and financial information were not in the emails, Anderson said, and Kaiser sent out letters to the patients who were affected.
 At the ID Theft Resource Center, experts advised victims to proactively contact Kaiser to see what steps they can take to protect their medical accounts from further access.
 “The greatest risk when medical information is compromised is medical identity theft,” said Mona Terry, vice president of operations at the resource center. “Someone can use the information compromised in this data breach and attempt to obtain medical services or prescriptions which will then be billed to the victim/victim’s insurance provider.”
 Together with a digital consulting firm called Futurion, the ID Theft Resource Center created a free software tool at breachclarity.com that allows consumers to see the security risk posed by a data breach and learn how to protect themselves. On a scale of 1 to 10, the Kaiser breach rated a 4, according to breachlarity.com.
 The year 2019 has seen some sizable data breaches at health care companies. In early May, for instance, billing services vendor American Medical Collection Agency revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had been hacked for eight months between Aug. 1, 2018 and March 30, 2019. That breach affected 12 million people at Quest Diagnostics, and other companies are still assessing the impact to their customers.
 Roughly 9.7 million Americans had health care records exposed, disclosed or stolen in the first half of 2019, putting this year easily on pace to surpass the 12.1 million individuals affected in 2018.
 Unlike credit cards and other financial information, an individual’s personal health history — ailments, illnesses, surgeries — doesn’t change, and it can be used to persuade unwitting customers that scammers are actually legitimate. In one such scam, fraudsters call up and pretend to be representatives of Medicare or a medical supply company. Then, along with your personal information, they use threats or incentives to get more financial information or to get your Medicare number. For instance, they may say they need the info to send free services, equipment or a new Medicare card. Alternately, they may threaten that you’ll be hit with fees if you don’t provide the information.
 HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF
 Consumer Reports suggests that consumers take these steps to protect themselves from identity theft and fraud.
 • If you don’t know the caller, hang up. Don’t engage with any robocallers because it can end up in more calls.
 • Know that caller ID is not always reliable. Scammers can make it look like their calls are coming from trusted institutions.
 • Don’t pay people who call you over the phone. More than likely, the person trying to get your money is an unlawful robocall.
 • Never pay by wire transfer, gift card or prepaid card over the phone. Legitimate companies and government agencies will not ask to be paid with Amazon, Google Play or iTunes gift cards.
 • You’ll be told a dramatic story. Resist the urge to act immediately. Stop and consult with a trusted friend or relative, even if the caller requests that you tell no one.
 • Report scam calls to the Federal Trade Commission at donotcall.gov or by calling 877-382-4357. Regulators can use the information in their enforcement efforts.
 • Register for the Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov. This may not reduce calls from criminals who ignore the registry, but it will reduce calls from the lawful companies.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1.0,990.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2017,Kaleida Health,NY,HACK,Email,"Kaleida Health has announced that a phishing attack has resulted in an email account being compromised, and along with it, the protected health information of 2,789 of its patients.
 
 Kaleida Health became aware of the incident on May 24, 2017, and called on a computer forensics firm to assess which patients have been affected and the extent to which its systems had been compromised.
 
 The firm determined the attack was limited to one email account. That account contained patients’ names, medical record numbers, diagnoses, dates of birth, treatment information, and other clinical data. The investigation did not confirm that ePHI had been accessed, although the possibility of a PHI compromise could not be ruled out. Patients have now been notified of the incident by mail in accordance with HIPAA Rules.
 
 The incident highlights the importance of security awareness training. However, unless employees have their skills put to the test in a safe environment, healthcare organizations will not be able to determine whether their training programs have been effective.
 
 One of the best ways to assess the effectiveness of security awareness training and resilience to phishing attacks is with phishing email simulations. Simulations should cover the most serious email risks faced by an organization, including general phishing campaigns, spear phishing attacks, business email compromise attacks and malware and ransomware emails.
 
 All employees should have their phishing email identification skills to the test in a safe environment to determine which individuals are the most susceptible to phishing attacks and who needs further training.
 
 Research conducted by PhishMe, a leading anti-phishing training company, has shown that susceptibility to phishing attacks decreases by around 20% after a single failed phishing test. Organizations that run multiple simulations have reduced their susceptibility to phishing attacks by up to 95%.
 
 When an employee fails a phishing test it can be turned into a training opportunity. That individual can be informed of the error and shown why the phishing email should have been flagged as malicious. Further training can then be provided to improve security awareness.
 
 While the majority of employees in an organization will be able to identify phishing emails and take the appropriate action following security awareness training, all it takes is for one employee to respond to a phishing email to expose the PHI of patients. Identifying which individuals have not taken training on board helps organizations to take appropriate action and prevent a real phishing attack from causing a data breach.",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0.0,2789.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2017,Kaleida Health,NY,HACK,Other,"Kaleida Health officials on June 26 discovered an unauthorized individual may have accessed an employee's email account. Officials immediately hired an outside computer forensic firm to investigate the incident.
 
 The investigation determined the unauthorized individual may have gained access to a small number of Kaleida Health email accounts, which may have included patient names, medical record numbers and diagnoses, among other information.
 
 Officials reported 744 individuals were affected in the incident, according to an Aug. 25 submission to HHS' Office for Civil Rights breach portal.
 
 There is no evidence patient information has been misused, according to Kaleida Health officials. However, officials are offering credit monitoring services to patients whose Social Security numbers may have been exposed.
 
 The notification follows a separate security incident, in which Kaleida Health officials began notifying 2,789 patients July 21.

2017,Kennewick General Hospital dba Trios Health,WA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"What Happened? On March 14, 2017 the Trios Health Information Management department identified electronic health record (EHR) access activity outside the normal job functions for one particular employee. An investigation was immediately started. The employee who impermissibly accessed patient records had access to our EHR applications to perform job responsibilities; however the employee utilized the EHR application to look up additional patients, where there was no obvious direct correlation to job responsibilities. The EHR fields that may have been impermissibly accessed include Trios Health dates of service/visits, diagnoses, and demographic information including address, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number, phone numbers, and email addresses. Upon learning of this incident, Trios Health immediately took steps to limit EHR access by the individual and began conducting an extensive investigation. Further EHR application permissions were restricted to all staff within the employee’s department as the investigation progressed. In response to our findings, and in accordance with our policies, we took disciplinary action against the employee including involuntary administrative leave, followed by termination upon confirming the nature and extent of the breach. Trios Health completed its investigation into the situation on June 22, 2017, and is deploying additional and extensive privacy training to employees, and implementing standard auditing processes to protect patient health information. 
 
 Did the Breach affect hospital or clinic records? The impermissible access was within our hospital EHR system. The majority of the access was within application functionality used by the employee for normal job-related functions; however that functionality was used to view patient data with no direct jobrelated correlation. 
 
 When were the affected records created? Impermissible access activity from the employee occurred between 10/23/2013 and 3/31/2017. Affected records were created throughout the life span of the Kennewick Public Hospital District [formerly dba Kennewick General Hospital (KGH) and now dba Trios Health]. Any visits prior to the implementation of an EHR in 2009 have limited information available. 
 
 How many people were affected by this incident? Investigation of the breach has revealed that the EHRs of 1,603 patients were accessed by the employee outside of normal job functions. 
 
 What actions did Trios Health take in response to this incident? Trios Health immediately took a number of steps to investigate and limit the exposure of this information. • Reviewed preliminary findings to rule out a legitimate business purpose for viewing the patient information in question. • Placed employee on administrative leave pending investigation. • Conducted interviews with the employee, as well as meetings with the employee and department manager. • Upon breach confirmation, filed appropriately with the Office of Civil Rights and the Washington State Attorney General. • Set up free identity theft protection services offering for one year for each affected patient, including a call center established to answer frequently asked questions and connect those seeking additional information with the Trios Health Information Management department. • Posted a disclosure about the data breach with a link to these frequently asked questions on the Trios Health website. • Deploying additional privacy training to employees, completing a full security risk assessment for privacy matters, auditing privacy policies, and implementing standard auditing processes to further protect patient information.
 
 Does Trios Health have any indication that anyone has suffered identity theft as a result of this incident? Trios Health has no way to know whether information has been or will be misused. However, it is recommended as a precautionary measure that patients affected by the information breach enroll in the free identity theft protection program being offered at no charge by Trios Health. 
 
 If my personal information was accessed by an unauthorized party, does that mean I will become a victim of identity theft? Not necessarily. Even if someone did access your information, this does not mean that you have been, or will become, a victim of identity theft or that the unauthorized individual intends to use your personal information to commit fraud. Trios Health notified you about this incident so you can protect yourself. Trios Health recommends that affected patients enroll in the free identity theft protection program being offered. 
 
 What is credit monitoring? Credit monitoring services protect primarily against new account fraud. This form of fraud occurs when a criminal uses your personal information to open credit card, mobile phone, or other financial accounts using your name, Social Security Number and other personal information. Beginning on the date of enrollment and for the specified time period, credit monitoring provides an alert whenever changes occur to your credit files. 
 
 Does Trios Health provide credit monitoring services? Trios Health is offering people affected by this incident a one-year subscription to an IdentityForce identity theft protection and advanced fraud monitoring (which includes credit monitoring) service. Trios Health is communicating with these people directly by mail about how they can pursue this option, including the individual verification code they will need to access the service at Trios Health’s expense. 
 
 How does The IdentityForce identity theft protection service offered by Trios Health work? IdentityForce protects your identity, privacy, and credit by continuously monitoring your personal information, providing you with early warning notifications if any discrepancies are found. 
 
 My access code for advanced fraud monitoring doesn’t work. What should I do? Trios Health has partnered with IdentityForce to provide identity theft protection. You may contact the dedicated Trios Health IdentityForce support phone line at 1-877-288-4664 to speak with an IdentityForce membership services technician. 3 I did not receive a notification letter. 
 
 Does this mean my personal information was not compromised? During the week of May 29, 2017, Trios Health began sending letters to the last known home address of every individual believed to be affected by this incident and for whom Trios Health has current address information. Following the conclusion of the investigation on June 22, 2017, similar letters were also prepared for distribution to additional patients identified as having been affected beyond those initially notified. If you have moved recently and you believe Trios Health does not have your current address, please call the Trios Health Information Management department at 509-221-5720 (option 2), Monday through Friday, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. You may also send any questions not answered in these FAQs directly to the Trios Health Information Management department at Privacy@trioshealth.org, and a Trios Health employee will contact you. 
 
 Should I contact the Social Security Administration to change my Social Security Number if my Social Security Number was part of the information that potentially was accessed/viewed? The Social Security Administration is unlikely to change your Social Security Number in the absence of any evidence that your Social Security Number is actually being misused. In addition, according to information on the Social Security Administration’s website, https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10064.pdf, changing your Social Security Number may create additional problems because you would lose your existing credit history and because other government agencies (including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Motor Vehicles) and private businesses (such as banks and credit reporting companies) are likely to have records under your current Social Security Number",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2009,Kern Medical Center,CA,Theft,Other,"BAKERSFIELD, Calif. -- Thousands of patients at a Kern County health clinic have been warned their personal information could have been stolen.
 
 A break-in happened at the Sagebrush Medical Plaza in July, and Kern Medical Center officials have notified 31,000 patients to take precautions against possible identity theft.
 
 But some patients complain the warning came nearly two months after the information could have been compromised, and they're not getting help the county promised.
 
 ""I had some negative credit reporting on my credit report,"" Marvin Brown said. He recently got a letter from a company in a small Idaho town saying he owes them money. ""I've never been to Idaho,"" he said.
 
 It could be misinformation from some other source, but he's worried -- after he got the warning letter from Sagebrush that his patient information could have been among papers in a storage unit that was broken into.
 
 The letters to patients are dated Sept. 2.
 
 ""One or more unknown individuals broke into a locked storage area that contained confidential patient information,"" reads the letter from Kern Medical Center. Sagebrush is part of KMC, and chief financial officer Fred Plane said they have no idea why anyone would take the paperwork.
 
 KMC officials notified the California Department of Health Care Services about the incident. Plane said the state sent out an investigator who looked over what happened, and what security measures the clinic has taken. He said the state will issue a report, but it's not clear when that will happen. KMC could then face reprimands or fines.
 
 Plane said all patient information has now been moved to a location inside the clinic building. It's located on Columbus Street in northeast Bakersfield.
 
 Plane said the records had been stored in a large, locked metal trailer behind the clinic. He said the papers were patient billing information, not medical records. But, ""several boxes"" were found overturned The storage unit was in a fenced and gated area. ""It had several layers of security,"" Plane said.
 
 When the break-in was discovered, Plane said it was impossible to determine exactly whose records might have been stolen. That's why every patient who might have been affected was sent a letter.
 
 But as a patient, Brown wonders why he got the letter in early September, when the break-in happened in mid-July. ""They could have warned us, they could have told us,"" he said.
 
 Plane said KMC did their best. ""We met the legal requirements of how long we had to report that. But because of county processes it took longer than we would have liked.""
 
 The letter to patients says the warning is only as a precaution. ""We have no evidence at this time that the break-in was for the purpose of stealing any confidential information or identity theft,"" it reads. ""However, we are making you aware of the incident in case you want to take steps to protect yourself against that possibility.""
 
 That's exactly what worries Trisha Villa. ""I have three kids there,"" she said on Tuesday afternoon. ""And you're worried about fraud, and all that -- identity theft.""
 
 The letter has advice for affected patients. ""To protect yourself form the possibility of identity theft, we recommend that you place a fraud alert on your credit files. This is a free service.""
 
 But, Brown said he contacted one of the credit bureaus listed on the letter, and he couldn't get a free fraud alert. ""I talked to the lady finally from Equifax, and she said that it would cost me to have a credit report.""
 
 One of Brown's neighbors is also a Sagebrush patient. She called Experian, and says she was told the credit report would be free -- but she would have to pay for the fraud alert. Neither patient is satisfied.
 
 And, both said they had a hard time reaching the KMC Privacy Officer listed as a resource on the letter. Plane said that office had been flooded with questions, and the officer had ""several hundred"" calls left in her voice mail.
 
 Plane promised KMC will help the patients, and answer their questions. ""If they have concerns -- give us a call,"" he said. ""And be confident we'll get back to them. We're taking down everyone's name and number, and getting back to them, because that's our obligation.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,31000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2010,Kern Medical Center,CA,PHYS,Other,"California's Department of Public Health has fined six hospitals $667,000 for failing to prevent patient privacy breaches. Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield was hit with the largest penalty, $250,000, for losing 596 patient records that were allegedly stowed in an outside, unlocked locker, Associated Press reports. State inspectors found that for several months, a Kern staffer would place daily lab reports in a broken locker outside the hospital. One night they were stolen. The hospital's CEO claims the reports' disappearance was part of a Halloween prank and not the work of identity thieves. Fines are typically $25,000 for the first breach and $17,500 for each additional breach of the same record. In another breach, Pacific Hospital of Long Beach was hit with a $225,000 fine after an employee used nine patients' medical information to set up fake Verizon accounts.The employee admitted to memorizing personal patient information during a project to purge the hospital's older ER records. California's patient privacy laws are among the toughest in the country, including penalties for snooping into medical records. The state law enacted in 2008 boosted patient protections after widely publicized violations of patient privacy at UCLA involving Farrah Fawcett, singer Britney Spears, Maria Shriver and other celebrities. Last year, California health officials issued the first penalty under the law to Kaiser Permanente's Bellflower hospital, which had to pay a whopping $437,500 fine for failing to prevent employees from sneaking a peek at the medical records of Nadya Suleman, aka Octomom, according to the Los Angeles Times.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,596.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
2012,Kern Medical Center,CA,Theft,Paper/Films,"BAKERSFIELD, Calif. -- Kern Medical Center is sending out letters to 1,500 patients notifying them their medical records were stolen.
 KMC officials said the theft happened February 25.
 A hospital resident physician conducting research printed out 1,500 records of patients who previously visited the clinic for valley fever, officials said.
 Officials said the resident took home the records in a computer bag, which she left in her car parked at her apartment complex.
 Officials said someone broke into her car and stole the computer bag with the records inside it.
 
 The records contained information, including names, health information and test results, and possible insurance information, officials said.
 There were no addresses, Social Security numbers or financial information in the records, officials said.
 KMC CEO Paul Hensler said hospital employees are all extensively trained in hospital policy, which prohibits the removal of patient records from the facility.
 ""This particular individual had attended more than one of those courses and had signed forms acknowledging they are not to remove records from the hospital but chose to do it anyway,"" said Hensler.
 County counsel will determine disciplinary action and the employment status of the resident.
 Meanwhile the hospital is subject to fines of up to $250,000 for failing to protect patient privacy.

2019,Kingman Healthcare Incorporated,AZ,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"KINGMAN – Kingman Regional Medical Center reported a “security incident” on its website, which was shut down on April 8 and, after two months, still remains under construction.
 
 The hospital established that “the configuration of the website made it possible for unauthorized person(s) to view some information entered into the website by KRMC customers,” the hospital stated in a Friday, June 7 press release.
 
 This incident did not impact all KRMC customers, but affected 1,100 individuals who used the “Request an Appointment” feature on the website (the vulnerable timeframe is estimated between November 2016 and April 2019. Information that could have been accessed includes customers’ names, dates of birth, and information related to their medical condition, KRMC stated.
 
 KRMC emphasized customers’ medical records, social security numbers, and financial information were not affected, and the hospital began contacting affected customers today.
 
 Since KRMC recently introduced a new electronic health record system assuring customers of its security, The Daily Miner inquired on the security of both systems.
 
 “The website is housed on a separate server, which does not in any way connect to our medical systems,” said Teri Williams, Communications & Marketing Director. “It is a ‘public’ website, not an in-house medical records system that is highly secure from public access. Therefore, the public can be assured that this incident in no-way impacted people’s medical records, social security numbers, or financial information.”
 
 According to Williams, KRMC “employs strict international protocols for protecting the security of our medical systems, which meet hospital accreditation criteria and federal standards. Since, our website is ‘public’ it is not subject to those same protocols. Going forward, we have engaged a cyber security firm that is developing a more secure site with more detailed audit and alert capabilities.”",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,158.0,1100.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2013,Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) (via Blackhawk Consulting Group),SC,HACK,Other,"In the largest data breach ever affecting Medical University of South Carolina records, the financial information for some 7,000 customers was stolen last month when a foreign entity hacked data from an outside credit card processing vendor, the hospital announced Thursday.
 
 Dr. Pat Cawley, executive director of the Medical University Hospital, said there are no immediate plans to terminate its contract with Blackhawk Consulting Group, an Illinois-based credit card processing company.
 
 “We are satisfied with how Blackhawk is responding and we’ll continue to work with them,” Cawley said. “This is not something that’s going to go away tomorrow.”
 
 The majority of customers impacted by the data breach are South Carolina residents who paid MUSC with a credit card over the phone or online between June 30 and Aug. 21. That represents a relatively small percentage of the MUSC patient population because the hospital treats about 1 million people a year, Cawley said.
 
 “Based on the information made available now, no patient medical record information was accessed during the theft,” a press release about the attack said.
 
 MUSC found out about the data breach on Aug. 22, but waited two weeks to inform customers as the institution devised a plan of action.
 
 “We were dependent on the forensic discovery process led by Blackhawk, who suffered the direct attack,” MUSC spokeswoman Heather Woolwine wrote in an email. “It’s a detailed and meticulous process, and has to be done correctly to make sure that we are providing the most accurate information possible to the public. Plus, you need time to set up call centers and get staff up to speed on the issue and action plan.”
 
 Woolwine said, “We’ve had little phishing attacks on our systems, but nothing like this.” She made clear that Blackhawk’s system was attacked, not MUSC’s system.
 
 MUSC is recommending that customers who were compromised by the data breach should contact their credit card companies and banks immediately.
 
 “Affected individuals will receive a pre-recorded phone message providing more about the theft, and MUSC is working with Blackhawk and Experian’s fraud protection program to launch a support system that will provide free credit monitoring through a customized call center designed to walk all concerned persons through the steps they should take to further protect their personal information,” the press release said.
 
 Blackhawk’s website lists dozens of other clients, including Yale University, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Northwestern University, but Mary Ellen Callahan, an attorney for the company, said only two other Blackhawk clients in addition to MUSC were impacted. Callahan would not disclose which other clients were victimized, but said they were not located in South Carolina.
 
 “We’re not at liberty to disclose that. That is their story to disclose, not ours,” Callahan said.
 
 In total, the financial information for about 10,000 people was affected by the breach, but Blackhawk’s other clients have not yet notified their customers. MUSC used the online payment system more frequently than the other two clients, Callahan said.
 
 The FBI has been notified of the data breach, she said. “It was a sophisticated cyber-attack.”
 
 MUSC Board of Trustees Chairman Tom Stephenson said the board members were notified about the breach Thursday.
 
 “I’m satisfied based on what I know that it’s not MUSC’s fault. If there’s blame to be had it’s on the vendor, not us,” Stephenson said. “That being said, MUSC is taking measures to minimize the chance that this happens again. We want to do everything to protect the public and our users from this type of criminal conduct.”
 
 MUSC has worked with Blackhawk for 10 years.
 
 “We’ve had a long relationship, never had any problems and felt very comfortable with them,” Cawley said.
 
 For some of the 7,000 MUSC hacking victims, their credit card numbers could have already been compromised as a result of last year’s cyber-breach of the S.C. Department of Revenue. In that case, a hacker made off with the personal identification information, including Social Security numbers, of 5.7 million present and former taxpayers. The financial information of some 700,000 businesses also was stolen.
 
 The Revenue Department cyber-hacking was the largest ever of any state, but the state waited until Oct. 26, more than two weeks after it learned of the breach, to let the public know they could be victims of identity theft.
 
 The state said it delayed notification to give law enforcement time to track the hacker, but so far authorities have made no arrest and have publicly said only that they have identified a foreign country where they believe the hacking originated.
 
 Authorities say they know of no case in which a victim of the Department of Revenue hacking has lost any money as a result of the hacking, but cyber-security experts say it’s just a matter of time.
 
 The state paid $12 million to provide free credit monitoring for the victims for one year and the legislature has authorized paying for an additional year. House Speaker Bobby Harrell, R-Charleston, recently told The Post and Courier that the state likely will have to pay for that for years.
 
 Cawley, of MUSC, said Blackhawk bears financial responsibility for the attack affecting MUSC customers.

2014,Kirkbride Center,PA,Theft,Paper/Films,"An individual in Florida was recently arrested and tried for causing a healthcare data breach that compromised patients’ PHI. The arrest of one individual soon led to the realization that patients’ protected health information (PHI) had been compromised. A small number of paper documents were stolen from a Florida behavioral health facility in August, and the alleged thief was tried for identity theft, according to the organization’s website. The Kirkbride Center stated that a “census sheet,” which contained patients’ names, addresses, some Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and limited insurance or medical information, was found when the individual was arrested. The healthcare data breach involves the information of 922 patients. However, Kirkbride added that the stolen documents were recovered and there has been no indication of a misuse of the sensitive data. “The theft occurred on certain dates in 2012 and 2013 and was discovered and reported to Kirkbride by the U.S. Attorney’s office in August 2014,” the statement explained. “An investigation by Kirkbride confirmed the only certain paper reports for certain dates containing some patient data was stolen. Kirkbride cooperated fully with law enforcement. A suspect was identified, arrested, and recently tried.” Using independent accreditation bodies for OCR security audits UCHealth Alerts Patients of Internal Healthcare Data Breach 1.13M Records Exposed by 110 Healthcare Data Breaches in Q1 2018 In a separate statement, Kirkbride President and CEO Rose DiOttavio said that while it is still unsure how the individual obtained the sensitive documents, Kirkbride has modified its internal reports and policies to protect against future occurrences. “We want to express our sincere regret to the patients of our Center whose personal information was stolen from our facility,” DiOttavio said. “We immediately began an investigation as to how these documents may have been stolen from the facility. The notification was delayed as a result of the law enforcement investigation.” Moreover, Kirkbride has arranged to have AllClear ID protect the identity for 12 months of anyone whose personal information was exposed on the paper documents at no cost to the patient, DiOttavio explained. The importance of training employees on the proper procedures when it comes to handling PHI has been discussed on this blog numerous times. Without a thorough understanding of HIPAA administrative safeguards, staff members could inadvertently cause a healthcare data breach. Unfortunately, an incident at a New York health facility appears to have been caused by this very issue. MetroPlus Health Plan announced on its website that one of its employees sent an email containing patient names, member identification numbers, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers to their personal account – instead of their MetroPlus assigned email account. “This action was done in violation of MetroPlus policy and the appropriate disciplinary action has been taken,” the organization stated. “There is no evidence that information has been misused, and we believe that the likelihood of such misuse is low.” Affected members have been notified and were offered reimbursement of a one-year membership in Experian’s Triple Alert credit monitoring product. While not going into specific security measures, MetroPlus explained that it has implemented new practices to better protect patient data.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0.0,922.0,92200.0,1.0,500000.0,1.0,650000.0,1.0
2011,Knox Community Hospital,OH,Improper Disposal,Other,"Hospitals on alert for X-ray thieves
 May 6, 2011
  
 When a thief left Knox Community Hospital in Mount Vernon with a truckload of X-ray film last fall, hospital officials thought he was an employee of a recycling firm hired to dispose of the material.
 
 Hospital employees learned recently that the film actually was taken by an opportunistic criminal hoping to cash in on the silver contained in it, a growing type of theft that has struck health-care centers in surrounding states. Only limited patient information was contained on the film, such as patients’ names, dates of birth and body parts identified, but hospital officials launched an investigation and notified police, Knox Community spokeswoman Prema Samhat said.
 
 “Our staff is undergoing refresher training, and policies will be reviewed and revised as necessary to safeguard against future incidents,” she wrote in a statement. “The hospital is reviewing its contracted services and considering options to do on-site document and film shredding.”
 
 She said the film likely was taken to a recycling center for processing. She did not have an estimate of the film’s value to the thieves. The theft was discovered through conversations between hospital employees and the recycling service the hospital had hired, Samhat said.
 
 Sgt. Jeffrey Jacobs of the Mount Vernon police said the thief told hospital employees that he recently had taken over the recycling operation, and he knew enough about how the hospital handles its X-ray recycling to be convincing.
 
 The thief took four 55-gallon drums full of film, which hospital officials told police were worth thousands of dollars. The hospital typically receives about $1,500 for its portion of the sale of the silver, Jacobs said.
 
 The price of silver has climbed steadily in the past year, with silver futures closing at a 31-year high of almost $49 an ounce on the New York Stock Exchange last Friday. Its price has tumbled since, however, closing at less than $35 yesterday.
 
 The theft of X-ray film is on the radar of hospitals across the state because they have to document the film’s disposal because of possible health and environmental risks, said Tiffany Himmelreich, spokeswoman for the Ohio Hospitals Association.
 
 She said federal regulations require hospitals to keep film for six years, but then it must be destroyed to protect patient information. Himmelreich thinks Knox Community is the only Ohio hospital to have had the film stolen.
 
 Dave Peve of Merry X-ray/SourceOne, one of the largest film recyclers in the country, said the hospitals he works with have been bombarded with offers from newly formed, and in some cases less-than-legitimate, recyclers as the price of silver has risen.
 
 Some don’t bother to make a sales pitch. X-ray film was confiscated from two men in Winnsboro, S.C., last fall after the men posed as legitimate recyclers in an effort to steal the film from a local hospital, according to news reports. Police found X-rays from 38 medical facilities from Florida to North Carolina in the back of the men’s SUV.
 
 Peve said hospitals could be out more than just the recycling fees if thieves take the X-rays, as federal privacy laws can lead to fines for hospitals that compromise patient information.
 
 “Hospitals have to be very concerned that they’re recycling within the federal guidelines,” he said.

 SEPTEMBER 16, 2012
 Speaking of the risk of mobile devices…
 
 Lahey Clinic reports that on July 1, a physician lost a Blackberry (or it was stolen) at an airport in France. On it were patients’ names, dates of birth, Lahey medical record numbers, diagnosis, and procedure names/test results.
 
 The clinic did a remote wipe of all of the data on July 6, but for five days, those data could have been accessed by anyone because not only was the Blackberry not encrypted, but it was not even password protected.
 
 In its August 24th letter to those affected (https://www.doj.nh.gov/consumer/security-breaches/documents/lahey-clinic-20120829.pdf), the clinic states, “We have taken corrective action steps to prevent a situation like this from happening again by encrypting all Blackberries and adding password protection to all devices.”
 
 To which I respond: Why the heck wasn’t this done years ago? Seriously, given the constant reminders about data security and the frequent media stories about the number of lost devices, why didn’t the clinic address this already? Should entities even be allowed to tell patients that they “take the privacy and security of your data very seriously” when there was no encryption and not even a password? And why were the data traveling to France? Were the data really needed there or was this all a needless risk? Their letter doesn’t address whether they think it was appropriate for the physician to take the patient data out of the country.

 Lakes Region General Hospital package containing patient medical information still missing
 By Bea Lewis
 Dec 26, 2008
 
 Despite crossed fingers, a package containing personnel medical information on 1,500 patients at Lakes Region General Hospital remains missing.
 
 Henry Lipman, executive vice president and chief financial officer at LRGHeath Care, said UPS shipped the parcel from a Woburn, Mass. central processing agent to the hospital but the package never arrived.
 
 State law mandates hospitals and others handling sensitive medical information to alert the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division if a breach allows such information to fall into potentially unsecured hands.
 
 Lipman explained the hospital has been using a central processing facility successfully for years without any paper files being lost or mislaid. It is common practice for hospitals and many businesses to use a central processing facility that can prepare accounting spreadsheets electronically and make numerous bank deposits throughout the day when insurance checks arrive.
 
 Information contained in the package includes patient names, dates of service and diagnosis code numbers for different diagnosis or medical procedures. No bank account or credit card information is included. What information is included varies from insurer to insurer, Lipman said, noting that workers’ compensation claims use social security numbers.
 
 Lipman has already faxed a letter to former Belknap County Attorney Lauren Noether, who now heads the state consumer protection division, notifying her of the breech. He was working on Monday to draft a letter that will be sent to patients whose information was contained in the lost package.
 
 “We want to be able to help relieve any anxieties that are out there by working with people,” Lipman said.
 
 While diagnosis information will be in a coded format, Lipman said, manuals are available that list the codes and could be obtained by the unscrupulous.
 
 Although the state law mandating reporting typically applied to information technology breeches, Lipman said the hospital felt it was appropriate to apply it to hard copies of information as well.

2012,Lakeview Medical Center,WI,Theft,Laptop,"WI: Computer stolen from western Wis. medical center 
 
 
 FEBRUARY 10, 2012
 
 This is one of those breach reports that stumps me every time. Keith Edwards reports for WQOW: 
 
 ""Hundreds of western Wisconsin patients are warned their medical and personal information may have been compromised. The Lakeview Medical Center in Rice Lake says a laptop computer was stolen from a car belonging to one of its nurses. The computer contained information about more than 500 patients of its homecare and hospice programs. That includes names, social security numbers, date of birth, home addresses, medicare ID numbers and diagnosis information. The hospital says it believes the risk of identity theft is very low, because the computer is password protected and the files are encrypted. Even so, all of the patients received letters this week informing them of the incident. The hospital is also offering to pay for one year of credit report monitoring services that specialize in identity theft cases. The nurse who was involved no longer works at the facility, and the hospital says it is taking steps to prevent any similar incidents in the future.""
 
 So if they were conscientious enough to use encryption, was it NIST-grade? If so, they had an exemption or safe harbor and there’s no need to notify or provide credit monitoring. And if it wasn’t NIST-grade, then I wonder why they didn’t take it to that level and avoid the costs of breach notification and monitoring.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,698.0,69800.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,90000.0,1.0
2013,Lancaster General Medical Group,PA,Theft,Paper/Films,"Agitated patient steals medical record containing personal data, Lancaster General says
 TIM MEKEEL, Business Editor Mar 7, 2013 
 
 A patient at Crooked Oak Family Medicine has stolen a document listing personal information about 527 other patients, the practice's owner, Lancaster General Medical Group, said Thursday.
 
 According to LGMG, the document, which was stolen Feb. 5, does not show patients' Social Security numbers, credit-card information or addresses.
 
 However, it does list patients' names, genders, dates of birth and whether they had received certain cancer screenings. It also shows whether a pediatric well child-care visit had been conducted and whether patients had received the pneumococcal vaccination against pneumonia and bacterial meningitis.
 
 All patients named on the spreadsheet have been notified by letter of the theft.
 
 LGMG said there's no evidence that the patient information on the document has been misused.
 
 Nonetheless, LGMG is offering 12 months of free identity-theft protection services to any patient on the document. The services include credit monitoring.
 
 The practice is at 1655 Crooked Oak Drive, off Eden Road.
 
 LGMG said the incident happened when an adult male patient at Crooked Oak became agitated and disruptive.
 
 To calm the patient, he was taken to the practice manager's office. But the patient grabbed a stack of papers from the manager's desk and ran out of the building, LGMG said.
 
 The patient returned briefly to the practice the next day, but without the document. Several attempts have been made to recover the document from the patient, but he has not complied, LGMG said.
 
 LGMG spokesman John Lines said LGMG did not immediately announce the theft because it's still trying to retrieve the spreadsheet.
 
 Lines said he was prevented by patient confidentiality guidelines from releasing the name of the patient who LGMG says stole the document.
 
 The patient has not been charged by Manheim Township police.
 
 ""No charges have been pursued at this time,"" Lines said. ""It remains an option under consideration.""
 
 Lines said LGMG continues to be hopeful that it can get the spreadsheet back from the patient.
 
 LGMG and Crooked Oak are reviewing its office policies and procedures to prevent a similar incident in the future.
 
 ""We take this matter very seriously,"" Lines said. ""We're sorry for the inconvenience it's caused.""",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,527.0,52700.0,1.0,40000.0,0.0,100000.0,0.0
2012,Landmark Medical Center,RI,Theft,Laptop,"Another Rhode Island healthcare organization, Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, informed affected patients of a recent data breach when it sent out a notification letter on Nov. 15. the breach involved a stolen laptop that held a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with patient data meant only for hospital staff use. The information reportedly didn’t include Social Security numbers, addresses or medical information and the hospital said that the data was being used to try to reduce patient time spend in the emergency room. However, it’s noteworthy that the hospital maintains minimal risk because the spreadsheet had “hidden” columns that made it difficult to access the data without knowing where to look. There aren’t too many CIOs or CISOs that would feel comfortable with this level of security, as even the highest level of security can be broken down with ease if data falls into the wrong hands. Whether the Landmark software security and privacy staff had a hand in sending out this letter that was supposed to alleviate patient concerns is unclear. But turnto10.com did talk to a security expert who found not having a password-protected Excel program to be unacceptable. “Two mouse clicks. You can hide a column in one mouse click. You can unhide a column in two mouse clicks. It’s really easy. That provides no security whatsoever. At a bare minimum, you should have a password on the Excel spreadsheet,” said Eric Shorr of PC Troubleshooters to the website. Questions such as what the hospital uses for physical and administrative safeguards haven’t been answered either. The hospital says that it plans on altering its software protection protocols so that if a laptop is ever stolen again, potential actors would need more than a few mouse clicks to access protected patient data. Specifically what they’re modifying may make patients feel better about data safety.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,683.0,68300.0,1.0,100000.0,0.0,168300.0,1.0

ORIGINAL POST: Logansport, Ind.– Logansport Memorial Hospital was the victim of a hacking incident that may have resulted in unauthorized access to certain information about the Hospital’s patients. On February 22, 2019, the Hospital became aware that an employee email account had been compromised through what is known as a phishing attack, where a malicious actor sought to obtain the employee’s username and password through a fake email that requested the employee to provide those credentials for a seemingly legitimate purpose. The Hospital immediately took steps to secure the account and ensure that the hacker no longer had access to it. The Hospital initiated an investigation and learned on or about March 18, 2019, that the compromised email account contained patient protected health information. Since then, the Hospital has worked to identify the individuals and information potentially affected by the breach. While the Hospital’s investigation was not able to definitively conclude whether the hackers actually accessed or obtaineda particular individual’s information, it would have been possible for the hackers to access and obtain patient information that was in the compromised employee email account. The information potentially accessed by the hackers was primarily in the form of surgical schedules that were sent daily to the Hospital employee for use in legitimate job functions. The potentially compromised information included some or all of the following: patient name, date of birth, age, medical condition/diagnosis, allergies, phone number, medical record number, name of surgeon, and date/time of surgery. It is important to note that the information did not include any personal financial information, such as social security number or credit card information. This incident did not involve or affect the security of the Hospital’s electronic medical record in any manner, and at no point was the Hospital unable to access the information needed to provide high quality health care services to patients. The Hospital sent letters to each of its affected patients to inform them of this incident and to identify the steps that patients can take to protect themselves from the potential misuse of this information. Although no financial information was in the account, the Hospital suggests that patients who are concerned about their information consider contacting the three credit reporting agencies to place a fraud alert on their credit reports, and to monitor medical records and health insurance claims information for any indications of medical identity theft. The Hospital has reported the incident to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, which is the federal agency that oversees the privacy and security of patient protected health information. Logansport Memorial Hospital deeply regrets that this incident occurred. The Hospital is committed to providing quality care and protecting PHI. The Hospital has established a call center to answer any questions that patients may have about this incident. Patients may contact the call center at (855) 424-2570 between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday.",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0.0,3568.0,356800.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,356800.0,1.0

 December 28, 2011 at 5:32 pm
 The private medical records of more than 1,300 patients and/or their guarantors were endangered for a time earlier this month when a Loma Linda University Medical Center employee took home documents against hospital policy.
 
 The records have been secured and the employee fired, said Briana Pastorino, spokeswoman for the medical center, in a news release.
 
 The records of 1,336 patients or those responsible for paying the patients’ bills were breached on or around Dec. 19, Pastorino said. Records included birth dates, addresses, medical records numbers, driver’s license numbers and, in come cases, Social Security numbers.
 
 The hospital is conducting an internal investigation to determine how the breach happened and how it can be prevented in the future, said Jemellee Ambrose, the medical center’s director of communications.
 
 Preliminary investigation provided hospital officials with enough evidence to warrant the employee’s dismissal, Ambrose said.
 
 The medical center will pay for one year of credit monitoring by the credit-management agency TransUnion for those whose records were taken to check for irregular activity, she said.
 
 The medical center alerted the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, the state Public Health Department and those whose records were involved in the breach, Pastorino said in the release. The medical center said that anyone concerned about the security of their records should call 1-800-242-5181.

 Security breach at Loma Linda University Medical Center affects 1,336 patients
 DECEMBER 28, 2011
 Steve Barrie reports: The private medical records of more than 1,300 patients and/or their guarantors were endangered for a time earlier this month when a Loma Linda University Medical Center employee took home documents against hospital policy. 
 
 The records have been secured and the employee fired, said Briana Pastorino, spokeswoman for the medical center, in a news release. 
 
 The records of 1,336 patients or those responsible for paying the patients’ bills were breached on or around Dec. 19, Pastorino said.

2011,Long Beach Memorial Medical Center,CA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"This breach happened in MemorialCare Health System. Long Beach Memorial Medical Center is the flagship hospital of the MemorialCare Health System (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach_Memorial_Medical_Center). 
 
 MemorialCare notified 2,250 patients of privacy breach
 MARCH 26, 2011
 A recent entry in HHS’s breach tool referred to a breach allegedly involving Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. As it turns out when I began to try to find details of the breach, the breach was not at LBMMC, but was at Memorial Health Services (MemorialCare Health System). 
 
 MHS has provided a copy of its statement on the incident: Memorial Health Services announced it notified 2,250 patients who may have been impacted by a privacy breach in 2009 and 2010 by a former employee working in the central business office. 
 
 Patients affected were notified in writing, given a toll-free telephone number to address questions or concerns and offered one year of free credit monitoring services. Patients with questions regarding this incident can call 1-877-810-7928. 
 
 At this time, there is no reason to believe the information was used in a malicious manner or one that would impact quality of patient care. The information accessed included the name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, phone number, account number and admit reason. 
 
 Memorial Health Services takes this incident seriously and has reviewed computer security procedures and determined that network security was not breached. It will continue to thoroughly review and strengthen its procedures to ensure the highest level of patient privacy possible and take all necessary steps to safeguard personal information. Memorial Health Services is in compliance with state and federal reporting requirements.

2013,Long Beach Memorial Medical Center,CA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"July 12, 2013 - Long Beach Memorial Medical Center alerted 2,864 patients who received treatment from September 2012 to last month that it has experienced a health data breach. PressTelegram.com reports that it was an internal employee who compromised the data, but there are no details as to how they breached the information. The organization only referred to the Long Beach Police Department when asked about the employee.
 
 Breached information included name, sex, date of birth, home address, phone number, account number, insurance information and the reason for admission. The hospital told the Press-Telegram that it reviewed its computer security procedures and determined that network security has not been breached.
 
 “At this time, there is no reason to believe the information was used in a malicious manner or one that would impact quality of patient care,” the hospital said in a statement. “Long Beach Memorial Medical Center will continue to thoroughly review and strengthen its procedures to ensure it maintains the highest level of patient privacy possible and take all necessary steps to safeguard personal information.”
 
 This statement can’t be all that comforting to patients, as they don’t know what type of employee inappropriately accessed their data and how exactly the organization plans on improving its patient data security procedures. According to the report, a police spokeswoman said the investigation is open and no arrest has been made.; Long Beach (Calif.) Memorial Medical Center has notified 2,864 patients of a possible breach of their private information, according to a Press Telegram report.
 
 Potentially compromised information includes patients' name, gender, date of birth, address, phone number, insurance information and reason for admission, according to the report.
 
 Affected patients have been offered a free year of a credit monitoring service, according to the report.; The Long Beach Press-Telegram reports that 2,864 Long Beach Memorial Medical Center patients' personal data may have been breached by an employee (h/t HealthITSecurity).
 
 Patients' names, genders, birthdates, home addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, insurance information and reasons for admission may have been exposed.

2012,Long Island Jewish Health System,NY,Other,Other,"North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System has sent letters to about 100 patients from its North Shore University Hospital who have been identified by law enforcement authorities as being victims of identity theft, the healthcare system has announced.
 
 Details are limited ""because we do not want to compromise the integrity of the investigation,"" according to a statement posted on the NSLIJ website Thursday. The statement noted, however, that nearly 1,000 people throughout the Northeast have been victimized by what it described as an ""identity-theft right that extends 'far beyond North Shore University Hospital.' ""
 
 ""If you have not received a letter from the hospital, law enforcement authorities have not identified you as a victim of this incident and we have no reason to believe that you have been affected,"" the statement said. Meanwhile, the system is working with New York State Police and the Nassau County District Attorney's office in the investigation and is ""taking aggressive steps to further safeguard the security protocols currently in place to protect patient information,"" according to the statement.
 
 North Shore LIJHS spokesman Terry Lynam said the system first became aware of the breach about a year ago and began notifying patients last July following the arrest of an identity theft suspect possessing ""face sheets"" from the North Shore University Hospital.
 
 The face sheets are patient information summaries created at admission for billing and care purposes. They list why the patient was seeking treatment as well as names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and, if available, insurance information. There have been six such 'incidences"" of arrests of one or more identity thieves involving 24 face sheets last year and 103 this year, Lynam said. Arrests were in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Virginia, he said.
 
 Financial fraud, not medical identity theft, so far appears to have been the goal in these breaches, Lynam said.
 
 ""From what our investigators were saying, the people who were found in possession of these face sheets were trying to apply for a credit card or to run up charges to the credit cards that were obtained fraudulently,"" he said. ""There was no evidence of them charging up medical bills.""
 
 Also, this breach appears to involve only copying of paper records, he said.
 
 ""There was no hacking into databases,"" Lynam said.
 
 Who copied the face sheets ""is still a matter for investigation,"" Lynam said.; North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System is facing a widening legal battle over allegations that it failed to notify hundreds of patients—including a doctor working at the system—that an identity-theft ring had stolen their unprotected confidential information.
 
 Twelve people have filed a $50 million class-action lawsuit (PDF) against the system and North Shore University Hospital, where thieves stole physical paper records called “face sheets” plus unencrypted digital files that contained patient information such as insurance numbers, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses and medical histories. The thefts occurred regularly “on or before fall 2010 and continuing at least through 2012,” according to the lawsuit.
 
 Plaintiffs' attorney Bonita Zelman, who also represents medical malpractice and police-brutality clients, said at least 20 people have contacted her since the 12-plaintiff lawsuit was filed Feb. 5 in Queens County Supreme Court to say they were also victims of ID theft at the 804-bed hospital in Manhassat, N.Y., and were seeking to join the case.
 
 Terence Lynam, spokesman for Great Neck, N.Y.-based North Shore-LIJ, confirmed in an e-mail that two people have been convicted and “multiple” other people have been arrested for operating “a widespread identity theft ring that victimized a number of organizations and about 1,000 individuals throughout the Northeast, including about 200 North Shore University Hospital patients.”
 
 Lynam said that no North Shore employees have been charged in the scheme. But he defended how quickly the system notified victims of information theft, despite allegations in the lawsuit that the system should have informed people sooner.
 
 “Any time we were alerted that any of our patients were affected, we sent out letters promptly,” he said. “Some folks have complained that they weren't notified, and it's because we didn't know.”
 
 The victims say the 11-hospital system failed to notify them that their information had been compromised, even as thieves traveled the country opening credit lines and bank accounts in patients' names, buying iPhones, maxing out patients' existing credit cards and even filing bogus tax returns using victims' information.
 
 One of the people suing the health system is Dr. Diane Peterman, who has been employed by North Shore-LIJ for 17 years and was admitted for major surgery as a patient at a system hospital on Jan. 23, 2012, the lawsuit says.
 
 Less than two weeks later, police in Arlington, Va., discovered the face sheet from Peterman's procedure among a cache of documents confiscated during a routine traffic stop there. The health system learned of the discovery on Feb. 5, 2012, the lawsuit says, yet North Shore officials waited until March 20 to notify her.
 
 In the meantime, Peterman received a bill from AT&T stating that someone had used her information to open five cell phone accounts and run up $2,292 in charges, damaging her credit rating.
 
 Peterman works as an emergency room physician at the system's 299-bed Huntington (N.Y.) Hospital, Lynam confirmed.
 
 Lynam declined to comment on whether the stolen files in any of the incidents had been encrypted or adequately protected. But he said the hospital has since taken aggressive steps to strengthen its security protocols, and that no identify thefts had been reported to the hospital in the past 11 months as a result.
 
 The class-action lawsuit seeks to represent anyone who had their personal information stolen from North Shore-LIJ hospitals, alleging that the system was negligent in how it handled paper records and failed to encrypt digital records, despite guarantees in its “Patients' Bill of Rights,” and then failed to notify affected patients until long after it learned of the thefts.
 
 The plaintiffs are seeking actual financial damages, emotional and mental damages, and $50 million in punitive damages “to deter such future reprehensible conduct and to advance New York state's strong public policy of ensuring that patients' privacy rights … are protected.”
 
 More than 21.5 million people have had their medical records compromised since September 2009, according to HHS' Office of Civil Rights, which compiles and publicly reports breaches involving 500 or more people. The North Shore incident, which the system says involved 200 patients, is not among the breaches on the list.
 
 Another 60,000 breaches of information involving fewer than 500 people have been reported to the Civil Rights Office, though those records are not made public.; MANHASSET, N.Y.—North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System has sent letters to about 100 patients from its North Shore University Hospital identified by law enforcement authorities as victims of identity theft, the system announced. Details disclosed were limited “because we do not want to compromise the integrity of the investigation,” according to a statement posted last week on the system's website. The statement noted, however, that nearly 1,000 people throughout the Northeast have been victimized by what it described as an “identity-theft ring that extends ‘far beyond North Shore University Hospital.'” The system is working with New York State Police and the Nassau County district attorney's office in the investigation and is “taking aggressive steps to further safeguard the security protocols currently in place to protect patient information,” according to the statement. North Shore-LIJ spokesman Terry Lynam said the system first became aware of the breach about a year ago and began notifying patients last July after the arrest of an identity-theft suspect possessing “face sheets,” or patient summaries created at admission for billing and care purposes. They list why the patient was seeking treatment as well as names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and, if available, insurance information.; Twelve patients have filed a $50-million class action suit against the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System alleging that it was negligent in allowing their confidential information to be stolen.
 
 In April, law enforcement officials revealed that an identity theft ring had stolen data from more than 100 patients at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. The information was contained on ""face sheets,"" the top sheets to a patient's hospital file that contain the person's name, address, date of birth, phone numbers and Social Security number. The health system first learned of the thefts in spring 2011, according to spokesman Terry Lynam.
 
 A member of the ring, Clincy M. Robinson of Brooklyn, was convicted in December of identity theft and sentenced to 6 months time served and 5 years' probation after he was found with printouts containing North Shore-LIJ patient information.
 
 North Shore-LIJ sent letters between 2011-2012 to about 200 patients whose identities may have been compromised, offering them a year of free credit monitoring, and set up a hotline, Lynam said.

 But the lawyer for the 12 patients, Bonita Zelman of New Hyde Park, said that was too little, too late. ""The heart of this is the risk to patients at North Shore-LIJ,"" she said. Speaking for the 12 patients she represents and others, she said: ""For the rest of their lives, North Shore-LIJ made them vulnerable to these thieves.""
 
 She charged that up to 4 million patients -- the number of ""patient contacts"" listed in North Shore-LIJ's 2011 annual report -- could have been susceptible to identity theft. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Queens, seeks $50 million in punitive damages and an unspecified amount for actual damages.
 
 The suit also alleges that North Shore-LIJ didn't inform patients for a year after it was made aware of a possible information breach.
 
 Lynam said the health system learned of the thefts ""primarily through law enforcement"" and informed patients ""promptly."" He said the system has been changed and there have been no breaches in 11 months since new safeguards were put in place.

 Paulette Schramm of Manhasset, a plaintiff in the suit, said she was in North Shore at the end of April 2011. Several weeks later, she learned that close to $8,000 was charged on her credit cards. She said she never got a letter from North Shore-LIJ and that when she tried to tell the hospital system about the security breach, ""they denied it.""

2013,"Louisiana State University (LSU) Health Shreveport, Siemens Healthcare",LA,DISC,Other,"Siemens Healthcare and Louisiana State University at Shreveport are notifying 8,330 patients of a HIPAA breach following a database mishap that resulted in billing and treatment information being mailed to the wrong patients.
 Officials discovered the breach March 18 after LSU began receiving calls from patients saying their bills were incorrect. ""After an investigation, it was discovered that an error had occurred in one computer data entry field,"" a LSU website notice read. ""When printing statements, this error caused the names and treatment information for one patient to incorrectly align with another person's mailing address.""
 LSU Shreveport Spokesperson Sally Croom said a variety of medical treatment data was compromised in the breach, such as complete blood count tests, vaccinations and other medical tests. The letters did not contain Social Security numbers, financial data and dates are birth, Croom confirmed.
 Notification letters were mailed to affected patients May 15. LSU Health Shreveport operates three acute care hospitals: the 459-bed LSU Medical Center; Monroe, La.-based EA Conway Medical Center and the Pinevillle, La.-based Huey P. Long Medical Center.
 When asked whether Siemens Healthcare or LSU was responsible for the error, Croom said they were unsure. ""That's a question that's going to come up (in the future),"" she said. ""Our focus has been on fixing the problem . . . and that involves safeguards for the database on both our parts,"" in an emailed statement to Healthcare IT News.
 ""Patient privacy is very important to us at LSU Health Shreveport, and we will continue to work with Siemens to ensure that the billing process executes correctly and without errors,"" added Croom.
 Siemens Medical Solutions also came under fire in 2010 when it lost seven unencrypted CDs containing the protected health information of more than 130,00 patients via mail.
 The state of Louisiana has only reported two other HIPAA breaches involving 500 individuals or more to HHS since the 2009 Breach Notification rule, which could be an indication of underreporting.
 This, says OCR's Leon Rodriguez, could easily turn into an enforcement issue with the new HIPAA rules, which were released in January. ""We're looking for that high level of sensitivity,"" he said at the 2012 Privacy and Security Forum. ""Failure to conduct activity monitoring was a consistent issue among a broad variety of agencies. So we are looking at that issue.""
 According to data from HHS, more than 21 million patient records have been compromised in healthcare data breaches since 2009, resulting in $15.3 million in enforcement activity.
 What's even more concerning, as Lisa Gallagher, senior director of privacy and security for HIMSS, pointed out at the 2012 Privacy and Security Forum, is that ""data breaches involving 499 or fewer are not counted in the HHS final count.""
 Gallagher estimated that between 40-45 million patient records might have been compromised. The number can't be confirmed, as the data isn't all there, she added, but it's a more accurate number based on healthcare organizations' reporting.
 Errors such as the Siemens billing database error are not to be taken lightly, said Washington, D.C.-based attorney and patient privacy advocate James Pyles.
 Electronic health information ""is accessible from anywhere in the world,"" he told Healthcare IT News. ""Once it's stolen electronically, it can exist forever, and it can exist in an infinite number of places.""; Officials discovered the breach March 18 after LSU began receiving calls from patients saying their bills were incorrect. ""After an investigation, it was discovered that an error had occurred in one computer data entry field,"" a LSU website notice reads. ""When printing statements, this error caused the names and treatment information for one patient to incorrectly align with another person’s mailing address.""
  
 LSU Shreveport Spokesperson Sally Croom said a variety of medical treament data was compromised in the breach, such as complete blood count tests, vaccinations and other medical tests. The letters did not contain Social Security numbers, financial data and dates are birth, Croom confirmed. 
  
 Notification letters were mailed to affected patients May 15. 
  
 When asked whether Siemens Healthcare or LSU were responsible for the database error, Croom said, ""Our focus has been on fixing the problem . . . and that involves safeguards for the database on both our parts,"" in an emailed statement to Healthcare IT News. 
  
 Added Croom, ""Patient privacy is very important to us at LSU Health Shreveport, and we will continue to work with Siemens to ensure that the billing process executes correctly and without errors.""; A database error in a computer entry field led to the disclosure of personal health information of 8,330 LSU Health patients.
 
 The hospital says it notified each patient on Wednesday of the release of personal information and that each patient’s bill contained incorrect information. A hospital news release says no Social Security numbers, birth dates, or financial account numbers were disclosed.
 
 Officials say they do not believe any of its patients’ financial information was compromised.
 
 The problem centered around an LSU Health contractor that prints and mails doctors’ bills on behalf of LSU Health. Siemens Healthcare, of Malvern, Pennsylvania, says an error in one computer field caused the names and treatment information for one patient to align incorrectly with another person’s mailing address.
 
 […]
  
 
 Finding LSU’s public notice proved to be no easy task, as it does not appear on LSU Health’s main site as far as I can tell, and it took a while before a Google search revealed that there was a statement on LSUShreveport’s site:
 
 Patients Notified of Unintentional Release of Personal Health Information
 
 Siemens Healthcare, a company that prints and mails doctors’ bills on behalf of LSU Health Shreveport, and LSU Health Shreveport are notifying patients of a computer issue which resulted in an unintentional disclosure of personal health information. No social security numbers, birthdates or financial account numbers were disclosed, so officials do not believe any financial information has been compromised. Corrected billing statements were reissued and patients have been advised to destroy the incorrect statements. Notification letters went out to all affected patients May 15.
 
 The issue was discovered when LSU began receiving calls from patients saying their bills were incorrect. After an investigation, it was discovered that an error had occurred in one computer data entry field. When printing statements, this error caused the names and treatment information for one patient to incorrectly align with another person’s mailing address. This affected the statements for 8,330 patients.
 
 LSU Health Shreveport and Siemens have identified the source problem and taken steps to ensure that this issue will not happen again.
 
 The LSU Health Shreveport Physician Billing Office has set up a toll-free response line for any questions or concerns that patients may have. The number to call is1-888-824-0379 or 318-675- 7550. It is staffed Monday through Friday from 8 to 4 pm.
 
 Back in December 2012, LSU Health disclosed that a hospital employee obtained financial information on 416 patients and used the information to others to create fake checks and credit cards. LSU learned of that breach from law enforcement, who believed that the breach may have begun in January 2012. In this case, it seems, they also learned of the breach from outside the organization. While it’s all too common for entities not to self-discover breaches, it does point out the importance of letting entities know promptly if you discover a problem with your records or statements.; May 16, 2013 - Following problems with patient privacy back in January at Louisiana State University LSU Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) that involved exposed protected health information (PHI), LSUHSC-Shreveport Vice Chancellor Hugh Mighty said that patient privacy policies will be reviewed and revised by June. Perhaps that wasn’t soon enough, as of 8,330 LSU Health patients’ data was compromised because of a billing database error where the wrong data was put in a computer entry field.
 
 LSU Health alerted patients of the breach on Wednesday that their billing statements contained wrong billing information, but didn’t include Social Security numbers, birth dates or financial account numbers. According to ksla.com, a LSU Health contractor, Siemens Healthcare, prints and mails LSU Health doctors’ bills and a single mistype in the computer field led to a patient’s name and treatment information becoming misaligned with another patient’s mailing address. Because of the incorrect rows, 8,330 patients received inaccurate billing data and LSU told them to destroy the incorrect statements within their notification letter.
 
 While LSU said that the problem has been resolved, this is also the organization’s second issue with patient privacy rights since January. What they’re doing to address the problem would be helpful for patients and the public in general.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,10.0,8330.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2015,Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-New Orleans,LA,Theft,Laptop,"STOLEN LAPTOP EXPOSES PATIENT INFORMATION
 New Orleans, LA – A laptop stolen from a member of the faculty of LSU Health New
 Orleans School of Medicine has potentially exposed the protected health information of
 approximately 5,000 minor patients primarily living in Louisiana and Mississippi. Dr.
 Christopher Roth, Assistant Professor of Urology, reported that his university-issued laptop was
 stolen from his car sometime between the evening hours of July 16 and the early morning hours
 of July 17, 2015. The car was parked in front of his home. Dr. Roth said he discovered the theft
 on the morning of the 17th as he was leaving to attend clinic. He reported the theft to law
 enforcement and the university. The laptop has not been recovered.
 The information on the laptop included names, dates of birth, dates of treatment,
 descriptions of patients’ conditions, treatments, and outcomes, lab test results, radiological and
 ultrasound images, medical record numbers, and diagnosis and treatment information. No Social
 Security numbers, credit card, bank account information or other financial data were stored on
 the laptop.
 When the theft was reported, the Office of Compliance at LSU Health Sciences Center
 New Orleans began the difficult and laborious process of trying to reconstruct the files that could
 have been stored on the laptop to identify any patients whose information may have been
 compromised. When using the laptop, the data were not saved to LSU Health Sciences Center
 New Orleans servers, but, instead, to the laptop’s hard drive, so the specific data stored on the
 laptop cannot be accessed by the university. The process to reconstruct and ready notifications
 took nearly eight weeks to complete. It is unknown whether any specific patient’s data were on
 the stolen laptop, however those patients the university suspects may have been affected will
 receive individual notification by mail, along with information about protecting against identity
 theft. While the exhaustive investigation appears to have found thousands of patients, others may
 remain unidentified. The university asks that patients of Dr. Roth from July 2009 to July 16,
 2015, who do not receive a letter either call 504-568-8672 or toll free 1-844-578-2656 or email 
 LSUHSCNO-PatientQuestions@lsuhsc.edu.
 Although the university is not aware of any access or misuse of the data, patients of Dr.
 Roth are strongly encouraged to visit the website www.identitytheft.gov, which provides a stepby-step process to respond to, and recover from, incidents of identity theft.
 The university genuinely regrets any hardships this incident may have caused. In an effort

2011,Lowell General Hospital,MA,PHYS,Other,"LOWELL — It is a scam that involves the theft of something unusual — X-rays.
 
 Thieves aren’t interested in your broken bones. They are recycling the old x-rays for their silver content.
 
 The emulsion on an X-ray consists of silver. During the silver recycling process using a simple chemical solution, the silver is released from the emulsion.
 
 As a result, thieves and con artists across the country are beginning to steal X-ray film at hospitals, veterinary offices and other places where X-ray film is used, according to RadiologyForums.com.
 
 Silver is a precious metal that can be traded for cash for about $41 per ounce.
 
 “Given the tough economy and high silver prices, it’s no wonder that x-ray thefts are on the rise across the country,” Andrew Thornton, sales director of B & D Associates, a medical recycling firm based in Concord, N.H., told RadiologyForums.com.
 
 X-rays are just the latest cash cow.
 
 Thieves have been know to strip pipes from homes and substations for the copper, taking storm-sewer grates and Dumpsters for the iron, and guardrails for the aluminum.
 
 Two years ago two former state Department of Conservation and Reaction employees were ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution for the theft of more than 2,000 feet of cast-iron coping that had been removed from the Longfellow Bridge.
 
 In Lowell District Court this week, two Florida men were in court to schedule a plea change for April 27 after they were charged last August with taking of a 50-pound barrel of old x-rays worth about $250 from Lowell General Hospital, according to court documents.
 
 John Mitchell, 25, who lists address in Hollywood, Fla. and Alexandria, VA., pleaded not guilty to a charge of larceny over $250 by false pretense. Co-defendant Gabby Miller, 38, of Hollywood, Fla., pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit larceny by false pretense.
 
 Attorney Daniel J. Murphy, who represents Mitchell, said the case should be resolved once there is an agreement on the restitution.
 
 According to court documents, Lowell police received a call from LGH security on Aug. 31, saying someone arranged to pick up the hospital’s barrel of X-rays to be recycled. Later a man showed up with a handcart wheeled the barrel away. Soon after, the security chief received an email from Evolved Technologies, of Salem, N.H., — a company that recycles X-rays — warning of a scam where people falsely claim they are company representatives so they can pick up X-rays to be recycled.
 
 Hospitals, medical facilities and veterinary offices in Massachusetts and N.H. have reportedly fallen victim to this scam.
 
 On the same day, Saints Medical Center in Lowell contacted Lowell police to say they were contacted by a man named “Miller” who would be picking up old X-rays. Police traced the phone number to Gabby Miller, according to court documents.
 
 Later that day, Lowell police were contacted by Newburyport police saying they had Mitchell and Miller in custody for taking a barrel of X-rays from Anna Jaques Hospital. Mitchell and Miller were charged by Newburyport police. Mitchell was also a suspect in the August 2011 theft of more than 1,000 X-rays from Harvard University Health Services, The Harvard Crimson reports.
 
 The results of those cases are unknown.
 
 When Lowell police spoke to Mitchell he allegedly told them he just started working for Miller’s uncle who owns a recycling business in New York, according to court documents. Miller refused to speak to officers, court documents state.; A suspected ring of medical records prospectors has been stealing patient X-rays at Massachusetts hospitals, hoping to mine the silver that is used in the photographic process, authorities said.
 
 Cops up and down the East Coast are looking at the actions of two Florida men who have been charged in two Massachusetts courts and banned from Bay State hospitals by a local judge, suspecting a larger operation might be at work, the Herald has learned.

 Earlier this month, Newburyport District Court Judge Peter F. Doyle slapped a stay-away order on Gabby Miller, 37, and John L. Mitchell, 24, after the pair pleaded not guilty to charges they stole a barrel of digital images being purged by Anna Jaques Hospital last month by posing as representatives of the Salem, N.H., firm contracted to recycle them.
 
 Although experts said the silver content of a single X-ray is small, a barrel full of old X-ray films can fetch as much as $300 as the value of silver has skyrocketed in recent years from $5 to $40 an ounce.
 
 “This has never, ever happened before. Who would ever think of doing this?” asked Anna Jaques, spokeswoman Deborah Chiaravalloti. “We’re walking it backward, reviewing how it happened. We are doing everything we possibly can to lock this system down and make sure it never happens again.”
 
 
 Newburyport police Detective John Schmidt, who busted Miller and Mitchell after setting them up to believe he had 15, 75-pound boxes of pet X-rays to sell, said he’s been contacted by cops “from New Jersey to New Hampshire.”
 
 Miller and Mitchell, both free on bail, are charged with pulling the same scam at Lowell General Hospital, where on Aug. 31 a man police identified as Mitchell in filings at Lowell District Court was allowed to wheel away a 4-foot-tall, 50-pound barrel of X-rays. Again, the thief claimed to be from Evolve Technologies of Salem, N.H.
 
 Both Chiaravalloti and Evolve president Glenn Coppinger said no Evolve employees are involved.
 
 “It’s all about the silver value, but I don’t know where they are moving the material to because it has to be refined. It’s a 3,000-degree furnace process,” Coppinger said. Police said Mitchell told them he drove a load of X-rays “to New York and turned them over to some Spanish-looking guy on 68th Street in Manhattan.”
 
 Charges against Mitchell are also pending in Cambridge, the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office confirmed, where Harvard University Health Services said images of bone fractures from 2004 and 2005 were stolen Aug. 31. Similar thefts are under investigation in Newton and Portsmouth, N.H. Miller and Mitchell could not be reached for comment.; LOWELL — It is a scam that involves the theft of something unusual — X-rays.
 
 Thieves aren’t interested in your broken bones, though. They are recycling the old X-rays for their lucrative silver content.
 
 The emulsion on an X-ray consists of silver that is released by a simple chemical solution during the recycling process. The silver can be turned into a profitable venture.
 
 As a result, thieves across the country are stealing X-ray film at hospitals, veterinary offices and other places where it is used, according to RadiologyForums.com.

 Silver is a precious metal that can be traded for cash for about $41 per ounce.
 
 “Given the tough economy and high silver prices, X-ray thefts are becoming more and more of an issue,” said Andrew Thornton, of B & D Associates, a medical recycling firm based in Concord, N.H.
 
 “Silver has gone up three to six times what it has been in the past five to seven years, so it makes it a good score for the criminals and because it had not been worth much to the facilities, they have not watched it as closely,” Thornton said.
 
 X-rays are just the latest target for cash-starved thieves.

 Loyola University Medical Center patients’ information compromised after car break-in
 MAY 27, 2011
 Tom Negovan reports:
 
 He raves about the medical care he’s received at Loyola University Medical Center, but a heart transplant patient says he can’t believe the hospital allowed his personal information to be compromised.
 
 Worse still, 63-year-old Vincent Cherry says, administrators are doing nothing to help.
 
 He was notified earlier this month that a Loyola employee’s car had been broken into. Among the items taken was a thumb drive containing vital patient information, including social security numbers.
 
 […]
 Loyola estimates fewer than 100 patients had data compromised, telling WGN News it’s doing everything it can to help them secure their personal information.

2013,Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,CA,Theft,Laptop,"June 13, 2013 - Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at the Stanford University School of Medicine is once again dealing with a data breach, this time it contacted 12,900 patients on June 11 to alert them that their data had potentially been compromised. This was Lucile’s second breach in the past six months, as back in January a laptop containing 57,000 patients’ data was stolen from its facility as well. In both cases, the laptop appeared to be unencrypted.
 
 According to a statement on its website, a password-protected, non-functional laptop computer potentially containing limited medical information on pediatric patients had been stolen from a secured, badge-access controlled portion of the hospital sometime between May 2-8, 2013. It repeated twice in the statement that there’s no evidence of any wrongdoing with the data, which included patient names, ages, medical record numbers, telephone numbers, scheduled surgical procedures, and names of physicians involved in a procedure starting in 2009. Lucile pointed out that Social Security numbers and insurance numbers were not included on the stolen laptop so patients wouldn’t worry about their identities being compromised.
 
 Lucile also said that efforts to recover the computer have been unsuccessful to this point, but the law enforcement investigation is still ongoing. At the end of the notice, it stated that it plans on augmenting its security measures:
 
 Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital strives to be an industry leader in the area of medical information security. As a result of this incident, we are taking additional steps to further strengthen our policies and controls surrounding the protection of patient data.
 
 EHRA: National patient identity matching strategy needed
 Bolstering user access without compromising security
 Aventura Hospital reports 82,601-patient data breach
 This is all well in good, but just like its statement from back in January, does not mention encryption. Here is what it said back in January:
 
 As a result of this incident, we are taking additional steps to further strengthen our policies and controls surrounding the protection of patient data, including redoubling our efforts to ensure that all computers and devices containing medical information are encrypted.
 
 Lucile also had a 532-patient breach back in 2010 that involved a stolen desktop, so hopefully this time it really does review its encryption practices and ensures that all protected health information (PHI) is encrypted.; Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif., has notified 12,900 patients about a potential data breach, according to a Health IT Security report. 
 
  
 
 According to the hospital, a password-protected laptop containing medical information on pediatric patients was stolen from the hospital between May 2 and May 8.
 
  
 
 The information includes patient names, ages, medical record numbers, telephone numbers and scheduled surgical procedures. It does not include Social Security numbers and insurance numbers. The hospital does not believe the information has been misused.
 
  
 
 This is Lucile Packard Children's second laptop theft resulting in a data breach in the last six months. A laptop containing the medical information of around 57,000 patients was stolen in January.; Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital is no stranger to stolen equipment containing PHI. In January, 2010, they self-reported a breach involving a stolen desktop computer with PHI on 532 patients, and as recently as January, they notified 57,000 patients after a laptop was stolen from a physician’s car. Now the hospital is notifying patients about another breach involving the theft of hardware with unencrypted PHI. From a statement on their web site:
 
 Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford is notifying patients by mail that a password-protected, non-functional laptop computer that could potentially contain limited medical information on pediatric patients was stolen from a secured, badge-access controlled area of the hospital sometime between May 2 and May 8, 2013. This incident was reported to Packard Children’s on May 8. Immediately following discovery of the theft, Packard Children’s launched an aggressive and ongoing investigation with security and law enforcement.
 
 To date, there is no evidence that any pediatric patient data has been accessed by an unauthorized person or otherwise compromised.
 
 What medical information was on the laptop?
 The information that could potentially have been on the stolen computer related to operating room schedules, which the employee accessed as part of her work functions through Packard Children’s secure and encrypted electronic systems. The computer was password protected, but some information could have transferred to the laptop, and the laptop was not encrypted. The computer was outdated and damaged, thus on a schedule for collection by information technologists.
 
 The information did not include financial or credit card information, nor did it contain Social Security numbers, insurance numbers or any other marketable information. The information on the operating room schedule that could have transferred to the computer would have been patient names, ages, medical record number, telephone number, scheduled surgical procedure, and name of physicians involved in the procedure over a three-year period beginning in 2009. To date, there is no evidence that any patient data has been accessed by an unauthorized person or otherwise compromised.
 
 How many patients were potentially affected?
 Out of an abundance of caution, we are providing outreach to approximately 12,900 patients, and we are assuring they are notified promptly.
 
 When did the notifications begin?
 Notifications to federal and state regulators, affected individuals and parents, and the media are under way as of June 11. Due to the law enforcement investigation, such notifications were delayed, as permitted by law, to avoid impeding the investigation.
 
 How are potentially affected individuals being notified?
 In addition to the mailed letters, a toll-free phone line has been established to answer questions for those notified. The toll-free number is (855) 683-1168, and is available Monday through Saturday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST. In addition, potentially affected individuals have been offered the option of free identity protection services.
 
 How is the investigation proceeding?
 So far, efforts to recover the computer have been unsuccessful, but the law enforcement investigation is still ongoing.
 
 Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital strives to be an industry leader in the area of medical information security.

2010,Lucille Packard Children's Hospital,CA,Other,Desktop Computer,"Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford will appeal a California Department of Public Health fine of $250,000 for alleged late reporting of a data security breach, according to a statement released by the Palo Alto-based hospital on Thursday.
 
 CDPH fined the hospital for allegedly reporting an incident 11 days late. During the isolated incident, which Packard Children's self-reported to CDPH in February, an employee apparently stole a password-protected desktop computer containing information on more than 500 patients and took it home in January.
 
 After the hospital and law enforcement found that the computer could not be recovered, it reported the incident to CDPH, federal authorities and families of patients that might have been affected. The hospital also offered families identity theft protection services.
 The former employee allegedly behind the incident now faces theft charges.
 
 Such failure-to-notify penalties are unique in the country, HealthLeaders Media reports. So far, state health officials have issued more than $1.8 million in fines against 143 hospitals that failed to report an adverse event or breach of a medical record, a wrong-site surgery or a retained foreign object.
  
 Hospital staff have been monitoring computer activity to see if the missing computer has been online anywhere, according to Ed Kopetsky, Packard Children's CIO. So far, nothing has come up.; Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University has been fined $250,000 by California health officials for failing to report within five days a breach of 532 patient medical records in connection with the apparent theft of a hospital computer by an employee.
 
 Under state law, that amount is the maximum penalty allowed for failing to report such an incident, according to spokesman for the California Department of Public Health, Ralph Montano. The penalty is assessed at the rate of $100 for every day of delayed reporting after the first five days for each patient medical record that was breached, he said.

 Madison Parish Hospital Service District Discovers PHI of 1,436 Patients was Impermissibly Disclosed
 Madison Parish Hospital Service District is notifying 1,436 patients of Madison Parish Hospital and its clinic in Tallulah, LA, that some of their protected health information has been impermissibly disclosed to a third-party.
 
 According to the breach notice uploaded to the hospital website, an employee of the hospital was discovered to have accessed a list of patients and disclosed that list to a third-party.
 
 Few details of the breach have been made public, so it is unclear who the third party was, the types of information that were disclosed, or the reason for the disclosure.
 
 Madison Parish Hospital believes the information was sent confidentially and there have been no further disclosures of the received information. According to the breach notice, the incident was discovered on February 20, 2018. The timing of the notification suggests this may have been a typo and the incident occurred in February 2019.; A former employee of American Indian Health & Services violated HIPAA rules by forwarding to a personal email account the email messages that contain the sensitive information of some employees, patients, and vendors. American Indian Health & Services operates a community health clinic in Santa Barbara, CA.
 
 American Indian Health & Services discovered the incident on March 7, 2019. An analysis of the former employee’s email account showed she forwarded email messages to her personal email account from March 26 to February 6, 2019.
 
 The emails contained the following information: names, billing data, names of provider and locations, amounts paid/owed for services provided, medical insurance and payor data, and Medicare/Medicaid and/or Medical numbers.
 
 American Indian Health & Services reported the incident to law enforcement, federal and state regulators and notified the people by mail. There’s no report of patient information misuse received to date. However, affected people were provided free one year credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services.
 
 The exact number of present and past patients that were impacted by the breach is presently uncertain.
 
 Madison Parish Hospital Service District is informing 1,436 patients of Madison Parish Hospital and clinic in Tallulah, LA about the impermissible disclosure of some of their protected health information (PHI) to a third-party.
 
 A breach notice posted on the hospital web page mentioned that a hospital employee was found to have accessed a listing of patients and disclosed it to a third-party.
 
 There is very little detail about the breach that was publicized. There is no clear information about the third party, the types of data disclosed, or the motive for the data disclosure.
 
 Madison Parish Hospital is convinced that there was no further exposures of data. The breach notice dated the discovery of the incident on February 20, 2018. It appears that the timing stated in the notification is a typo and most likely the incident was discovered on February 2019.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,30.0,1436.0,143600.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2010,Mahaska County Hospital,IA,INSD,Other,"Clark Kauffman of the Des Moines Register has a round-up of area hospitals that have fired employees for snooping in patient files:
 
 In each of the cases, the workers had unfettered access to portions of patients’ medical records. Some allegedly used that access to snoop through the patient files out of purely personal interest, while others are accused of improperly sharing patient information with others.
 
 Mahaska County Hospital fired a patient-orders coordinator for snooping. One of the patients whose data were improperly accessed was a volunteer at the hospital; the other was the ex-wife of the coordinator’s current boyfriend. Another patient-orders coordinator at the hospital was also fired for snooping; some of the patients whose records she improperly accessed were the mother of her adopted child, her ex-husband, her husband, and other relatives. The hospital did not seem to have uncovered the privacy breaches on their own and only seem to have found them when others filed complaints.
 Keokuk Area Hospital fired an employee after she allegedly used Facebook to exchange public messages about a patient with another health care professional.
 Mercy Hospital Medical Center of Des Moines fired an employee for snooping into patient files they had reportedly been cautioned not to access — files that related to the birth of a child at the hospital.
 University of Iowa Hospitals fired a clerk in the phlebotomy clinic in a “loose lips” incident. According to the newspaper report, she allegedly told a co-worker, in the presence of several other hospital employees, about a patient who played on one of the university’s sports teams, revealing both his name and medical condition for which he was having blood drawn.
 According to Kauffman:
 
 In each of the cases, the workers had unfettered access to portions of patients’ medical records.
 
 Security and access controls — as well as audits of access logs — are an essential part of good security and privacy controls. Although the hospitals may have done the right thing in terminating employees who violate patient privacy, and keeping in mind that in at least some cases, they did not discover breaches on their own, it would be nice to know what changes they have since made to prevent unfettered access.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2015,MaineGeneral Health,ME,HACK,Network Server,"AUGUSTA, Maine — MaineGeneral Health suffered a cyberattack on its computer network last month that compromised personal information belonging to patients, employees and prospective donors, the health system announced Tuesday.
 
 While investigation into the breach continues, patients referred to MaineGeneral Medical Center for radiology services, such as MRIs and CT scans, over the last several years appear to be at the highest risk. Data identified as potentially compromised by the Federal Bureau of Investigations include dates of birth and emergency contact names, addresses and telephone numbers for patients referred by treating physicians to the hospital for those services since June 2009.
 
 
 It also includes names, addresses and telephone numbers of certain employees, and similar information for certain prospective donors, the health system said.
 
 The compromised data identified so far do not include Social Security numbers, patient names, patient medical or health insurance information, health records, driver’s license numbers, or credit and financial account information, according to MaineGeneral.
 
 The breach potentially affects patients of all MaineGeneral Health subsidiaries, including MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta, MaineGeneral Rehabilitation and Long Term Care, MaineGeneral Retirement Community and MaineGeneral Community Care.
 
 
 The FBI notified the health system on Nov. 13 “of the detection of certain MaineGeneral data on an external website that is not accessible by the general public,” according to a MaineGeneral news release. CEO Chuck Hays said the FBI declined to share that website with the health system.
 
 MaineGeneral immediately launched an investigation and continues to cooperate with the FBI to determine the source and extent of the data breach, the news release states.
 
 “We take any threat to the security of information entrusted to us very seriously,” Hays said in the release. “Once the attack was discovered, we immediately took countermeasures and also hired nationally-renowned computer forensic investigators to determine exactly what happened and what information is at risk. … We apologize for any inconvenience this incident may cause our community.”
 
 
 Officials are still trying to determine how the “sophisticated cyber attack” occurred and who’s responsible, Hays said.
 
 The release did not specify how many people were potentially affected by the cyberattack. But federal law typically requires health care organizations to notify the media of data breaches that could affect more than 500 patients.
 
 More than three weeks have passed since the FBI notified the health system of the breach. Hays said MaineGeneral had to first verify the data, identify who was affected and set up a call center and credit monitoring for affected individuals during that time.
 
 
 “In the world of data breaches, this is probably lightning speed,” he said.
 
 The health system said it will mail letters to affected patients. It has also informed the Maine attorney general’s office, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, the Maine Computer Crimes Task Force, the Augusta Police Department, and the U.S. DHHS Office of Civil Rights, Hays said.
 
 “To our knowledge, we’ve never experienced a cyber attack before,” he said.
 
 
 The assistance line for anyone seeking additional information regarding the data breach can be reached at 877-441-2645, 9 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday-Saturday.
 
 Although the information identified thus far by the FBI did not include financial or account information, MaineGeneral said it will offer affected individuals one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity restoration services.
 
 “This incident has impacted both our patients, our employees, our donors and quite frankly our family and friends,” Hays said. “It’s really quite disheartening. We’re making it a top priority to address this issue.”
 
 
 U.S. Sen. Angus King, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he has contacted the FBI about the data breach.; AUGUSTA, Maine — MaineGeneral Medical Center has determined additional protected health information impacting some individuals may have been accessed in the cyberattack on its computer network.
 
 Letters to those impacted are being sent Friday, explaining the stage of the investigation and ways individuals can protect themselves, including access to free credit monitoring and identity restoration services MaineGeneral is offering to those receiving letters of notification.
 
 
 On Nov. 13, 2015, MaineGeneral was notified by the FBI of the detection of certain data, believed to belong to MaineGeneral, on an external website not hosted by MaineGeneral and not accessible by the general public.
 
 Upon being contacted by the FBI, MaineGeneral launched an internal investigation by its IT team, and on Nov. 18, 2015, MaineGeneral validated the data supplied by the FBI as MaineGeneral data.
 
 MaineGeneral hired a cyber security forensics firm to supplement the internal investigation by its IT team. MaineGeneral continues to cooperate with the FBI.
 
 Information Compromised
 
 While the FBI investigation continues, MaineGeneral’s investigation is nearing completion. The forensic team has determined certain protected health information on its network was or may have been subject to unauthorized access on or about Sept. 11 and Sept. 12, 2015, including the following:
 
 — The following information relating to patients referred for radiology services since June of 2009: name, address, date of birth, demographic information, medical information including name of referring physician and allergy information, Social Security number, medical insurance information, medical record number, emergency contact information, guarantor information and employer information.
 
 — The names, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, attending physician name, account number and age of certain patients in a patient advocacy file.
 
 
 — The names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, medical record numbers, treatment information and health history information of certain patients in a patient diagnostic registry file.
 
 — The names and addresses of certain patients on a mailing list file related to a physician departure in October 2010.
 
 — The names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and medical identification numbers of certain patients in a monitoring system file.
 
 
 — The name, address, procedure date, procedure description, diagnosis and treatment choice of a patient in a letter to the patient.
 
 — The names, addresses and telephone numbers of certain employees.
 
 — The names, addresses and telephone numbers of certain prospective donors.
 
 
 MaineGeneral has established a dedicated assistance line for anyone seeking additional information regarding this incident, as well as steps to better protect against identity theft.
 
 This assistance line can be reached at 1-877-216-8137, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Friday. Please provide the following reference number when calling: 636-201-0416.; 
 
 MaineGeneral Health (MaineGeneral), located in Augusta, Maine, notified employees and patients last
 week that personal information and protected health information was compromised in a cyber-attack last
 month. The health care provider system was notified by the FBI on November 13 that its information was
 located on an external website not accessible to the general public.
 The compromised information of an unknown number of individuals included names, addresses, and
 telephone numbers of certain employees and prospective donors, as well as dates of birth and
 emergency contact names, addresses, and telephone numbers of patients referred for radiology services
 by one physician since 2009.
 Although MaineGeneral indicates that no Social Security numbers or financial information is known to
 have been compromised, the investigation is ongoing, and therefore, MaineGeneral is offering affected
 individuals one year of credit monitoring and identity restoration services as a precaution.

 Prima Medical Foundation supports the Prima Medical Group, many of whose doctors work closely with Marin General Hospital.
 
 The computer records of Marin Medical Practice Concepts, a Novato company that provides medical billing and electronic medical records services to many Marin physicians, were hacked on July 26. As a result, some Marin doctors were unable to access their patients’ medical records for more than a week.
 
 Responding to questions from the Independent Journal on Aug. 4, Lynn Mitchell, CEO of Marin Medical Practice Concepts, confirmed the malware attack. In her email, Mitchell wrote, “Ransom was paid. For security reasons we will not be releasing the amount or denomination paid.”

 Typically in such ransomware attacks, a sophisticated computer virus finds its way into a victim’s system when an unsuspecting employee opens an email attachment. The virus encrypts the system’s data and attackers essentially hold the data hostage until the owners of the information pay a ransom, typically in an untraceable digital currency such as Bitcoin.
 
 The Marin Healthcare District and Prima Medical Foundation issued nearly identical press releases on Wednesday, stating, “The third-party forensic firm hired to investigate this incident found no evidence that patient personal, financial, or health information was accessed, viewed, or transferred.
 
 “However, during the restoration process, one of MMPC’s backup systems failed, causing information to be lost that was collected at the district’s nine medical care centers between July 11, 2016 and July 26, 2016.”
 
 The release went on to say: “This information includes vital signs, limited clinical history, documentation of physical examinations, and any record of the communication between patients and their physician during a visit in that 15 day period. Results of diagnostic tests were not lost and patients do not need to be re-tested.”
 
 Faulty system
 
 Jamie Maites, a spokeswoman for Marin General Hospital, said, “The ransom unlocked the data; however, at the time of the incident, we were in the middle of a system upgrade. The data loss occurred at the time of the system restore due to a faulty backup system — not due to the malware.”
 
 Maites said Marin General’s systems were unaffected by either the ransomware or the failed backup systems. The patients being notified are patients of physician practices that are part of the Marin Healthcare District Medical Care Centers and Prima Medical Foundation.
 
 She said the ransomware attack was reported to the FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights as required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA.
 
 In a statement, Lee Domanico, chief executive of the Marin Healthcare District, said, “Our community can rest assured that the Marin Healthcare District will continue to work side by side with our vendors to ensure that all of our data is protected with today’s most advanced technology to reinforce their security systems against the most aggressive threats.”
 
 Health hacking
 In a similar statement, Dr. Robert Newbury, chief executive of the Prima Medical Foundation, said, “It is unfortunate that these types of cyber-attacks have become so common.”
 
 In February, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles paid a ransom of $17,000 in the hard-to-trace digital currency Bitcoin in order to regain access to its data. Then in March, four more organizations fell victim: MedStar Health, which operates 10 hospitals throughout the District of Columbia and Maryland; Chino Valley Medical Center in Chino; Desert Valley Hospital in Victorville and Methodist Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.
 
 According to a report issued by the Attorney General’s Office in February, in the past four years the attorney general has received reports on 657 data breaches affecting a total of more than 49 million records of Californians.
 
 The report said that malware and hacking present the greatest threat, accounting for 54 percent of the breaches. The report added that health care, which accounted for 16 percent of breaches, is starting to see an increase in hacking breaches as the sector transitions to electronic medical records. And it said that the “most vulnerable information in health care was medical information, such as patient records, and Social Security numbers.”
 
 Anyone who believes they may have been affected by this data loss and has not received a letter by Saturday is encouraged to call a dedicated call center at 1-844-607-1698 between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday through Friday.; Computers at Marin Healthcare District’s nine medical care centers were hit with a virus that holds data hostage but officials are not discussing details.
 
 The district said that although no financial or personal patient information was found to be compromised, one of the company’s backup systems failed during the data-restoration process, resulting in a loss of information collected at its nine medical care centers July 11–26.
 
 The lost data includes vital signs, limited clinical history, documentation of physical examinations and any record of communication between patients and their physicians during a visit in that 15-day period. Results of diagnostic tests were not lost, and patients do not need to be re-tested, officials said in a statement.
 
 A ransom was paid to regain access to the data, according to the Marin Independent Journal, but requests for further comments from Marin Medical Practices Concepts, Inc., the Novato-based company that provides the district with business and health care system services, went unanswered. Security reasons were cited.
 
 “If they reported it to the FBI, law enforcement are cautious about what you say when an investigation is going on,” said Tony Schoenberg, partner, Farella Braun + Martel, and co-founder of the firm’s Privacy and Cybersecurity Team.
 
 After a hack such as this, companies are required to take certain steps, according to state law. Health care organizations that store individuals’ health information are a little different in that they also must notify the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.
 
 A press release is typically issued to give the organization some control over the message going out to the public.
 
 “People are going to find out anyway,” Schoenberg said.
 
 In a statement issued by MHD Sept. 28, officials said patient information doesn’t seem to have been exposed. A third-party forensic firm hired to investigate the incident found no evidence that patient personal, financial or health information was accessed, viewed or transferred, according to officials.
 
 In the statement, Lee Domanico, CEO of the district, stated “The privacy and confidentiality of our patient data is of utmost importance to the Marin Healthcare District. We sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident has caused to our patients or physicians. Our community can rest assured that the Marin Healthcare District will continue to work side by side with our vendors to ensure that all of our data is protected with today’s most advanced technology to reinforce their security systems against the most aggressive threats.”

 Marin patient records thought lost in malware attack
 
 Marin Medical Practice Concepts also supplies electronic medical records services to Prima Medical Group’s 48 Marin physicians, who also issued a statement. In it, Dr. Robert Newbury, CEO of the Prima Medical Foundation, said, “While the electronic health record has not been fully operational, offices have remained open and able to provide patient care.”
 
 MHD and Prima received notice July 26 that computers at Marin Medical Practices Concepts were infected with a ransomware virus, a computer virus that encrypts data on an infected system and demands something in exchange for unlocking the data.
 
 Software breaches often occur when an employee will click on an email link or attachment, Schoenberg said.
 
 Hackers are very, very sophisticated. “It’s like a game of Whack-a-Mole. You fix one vulnerability and they find another,” he said.
 
 The nine MHD clinics affected are Cardiovascular Center of Marin, Marin Endocrine Center, Marin Internal Medicine, North Bay Urology, North Marin Internal Medicine, San Rafael Medical Center, Sirona Vascular Center, Tamalpais Internal Medicine and West Marin Medical Center. The district also owns Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae.
 
 The district is mailing letters to potentially affected patients and has established a dedicated call center to address questions or concerns. Those who believe they may be affected by this incident but have not received a letter are encouraged to call 844-607-1698 Monday–Friday, 6 a.m.–6 p.m.

 The organizationMarin Healthcare Districtsays that on July 26 one of its key vendors, Marin Medical Practices Concepts Inc., experienced a ransomware infection.
 
 Ransomware is a type of malware that severely restricts access to a computer, device or file until a ransom is paid by the user. This class of malware is a criminal moneymaking scheme that can be installed through deceptive links in an e-mail message, instant message or website and can lock a computer screen or encrypt files with a password, says Kaspersky Lab, a developer of anti-virus software and related applications. The criminals typically then demand money in exchange for releasing the password so the hacked organization can access its files.
 
 Marin Medical Practices, a provider of medical billing and electronic health records services to Marin Healthcare District, realized it was the victim of a ransomware incident after one of its backup systems failed, causing the loss of information that was collected at nine medical care centers between July 11 and July 26. The information included vital signs, limited clinical history, documentation of physical examinations, and records of the communication between patients and their physician during a visit in that 15-day period, says Marin Healthcare. The incident impacted about 5,000 patients, the health system says.
 
 In a letter to patients and others affected by the ransomware incident Marin Healthcare District CEO Lee Domanico wrote that a follow-up investigation revealed that this incident found no evidence that patient personal, financial, or health information was accessed, viewed, or transferred.

 But Marin Healthcare and Marin Medical Practices did pay an undisclosed ransom to have the cyberthieves unlock the data files. Formerly known as Marin Hospital District, Marin Healthcare is a public entity that owns Marin General Hospital and nine medical care centers throughout Marin County in northern California.
 
 Marin Healthcare isnt saying much about steps taken to prevent further ransomware attacks. In his letter Domanico notes that the health system did report the cybercrime to the FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servcies Office of Civil Rights, which oversees hospital data breach administration, and various California state agencies. The Marin Healthcare District will continue to work side by side with our vendors to ensure that all of our data is protected with todays most advanced technology to reinforce their security systems against the most aggressive threats, Domanico says.
 
 Marin Healthcare says the health system has sent letters to patients impacted by the ransomware incident and established a toll-free phone number for patients. But Marin Healthcare did not release specifics of what support it was offering those patients impacted by the cybercrime, such as offering free crediting monitoring and identity recovery services.
 
 Marin Healthcare is the second California health system to report a ransomware incident in the past week. In a statement posted on its web site Keck Hospitals CEO and chief operating officer for Keck Medicine of the University of Southern California Rodney Hanners reported that on Aug. 1 a ransomware attack occurred on servers at two hospitals, including Keck Medical Center, a 240-bed hospital, and USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center Hospital, a 60-bed facility.
 
 Ransomware attacks and other forms of cybercrime are becoming a big security concern for healthcare organizations of all sizes, says Lee Barrett, executive director of the Electronic Healthcare Accreditation Commission. The bottom line is that organizations need to be proactive, vigilant, be willing to invest in a comprehensive security strategy with the appropriate rigor and tactics and third-party reviews of the infrastructure, Barrett says. Organizations need to fully understand the risks, costs, exposures and take the appropriate actions to mitigate those gaps and vulnerabilities to reduce the risk of a HIPAA breach, incident, cyber or ransomware attack.

 Mass. Eye and Ear Alerts Patients to Data Breach
 4-Jan-2010 
 
 Newswise — On Nov. 30, 2009 the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary discovered that a patient’s credit card had been inappropriately used on Nov. 11 and 12 by a Mass. Eye and Ear employee. 
 
 Mass. Eye and Ear conducted an investigation and determined that two employees were involved, both of whom were terminated. We reported this situation to the Boston Police Department. In addition, as required by law, Mass. Eye and Ear is reporting this incident to the appropriate state and federal authorities.
 
 While Mass. Eye and Ear is only aware of one credit card that was actually misused, Mass. Eye and Ear has determined that approximately 1,076 individuals used credit cards that may have been physically handled or taken over the telephone by the two employees.
 
 Mass. Eye and Ear is sending letters to potentially affected patients at their last known address. The hospital has posted a notice on its website in the event that the contact information for potentially affected patients is out of date, and to provide notice to approximately 35 individuals for whom Mass. Eye and Ear has no contact information. In addition, individuals who used their credit cards to pay for services provided to friends or family members who are patients also may have been potentially affected.
 
 Only individuals who paid for services using credit cards in the departments and between the dates outlined below have been determined to be potentially affected by this incident at this time.

2010,Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary,MA,PORT,Other,"On February 19, 2010, a laptop belonging to a physician affiliated with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary was stolen while the physician was lecturing in South Korea. The laptop belonged to Dr. Robert Levine, a neurologist with a particular focus on ringing in the ears, or tinnitus.
 
 To date, Mass. Eye and Ear has determined that data owned by Mass. Eye and Ear on Dr. Levine’s laptop contained demographic and health information of approximately 3,526 patients treated by Dr. Levine at Mass. Eye and Ear between February 3, 1988 and February 16, 2010, and of a small number of participants in research conducted by Dr. Levine at Mass. Eye and Ear who were not also Dr. Levine’s patients, as follows:
 
 67 participants in somatic tinnitus modulation research, and
 One participant in pulsatile tinnitus research.
 Dr. Levine reported the theft to police in South Korea. In addition, as required by law, Mass. Eye and Ear is reporting the loss of its patient and research participant information to the individuals affected, and to the appropriate state and federal authorities.
 
 The following types of information about affected individuals associated with Mass. Eye and Ear may have been present on Dr. Levine’s laptop:
 
 Name,
 Address,
 Telephone numbers,
 E-mail,
 Date of birth and age,
 Sex,
 Medical record numbers,
 Dates of service,
 Medical information, including diagnoses, symptoms, test results, and prescriptions,
 Name and contact information for patient pharmacies, and
 Research participant status.
 In addition, four individuals’ information also included their pharmacy insurance account number.
 
 To the best of Mass. Eye and Ear’s knowledge, Social Security numbers, financial account numbers and credit card or debit card numbers of individual associated with Mass. Eye and Ear were not present on the laptop.
 
 Mass. Eye and Ear is sending letters to affected individuals at their last known address. The hospital has posted a notice on its website in the event that the contact information for affected individuals is out of date and to provide notice to individuals for whom Mass. Eye and Ear has no contact information.
 
 Individuals who fit into one of the categories above, and who do not receive a letter directly from Mass. Eye and Ear, may contact the Mass. Eye and Ear Breach Response Center at 877-313-1395 to determine if they are affected.
 
 Mass. Eye and Ear has no indication that the information on the stolen computer has actually been accessed or inappropriately used. The computer was password protected and contained a tracking device commonly referred to as “LoJack.” The tracking device contacted LoJack on March 9 when the stolen computer was connected to the internet in South Korea. LoJack was able to monitor the computer’s configuration and on-line use, and determined that:
 
 A new operating system was installed on the computer following the theft, and
 Software needed to access most of the information about affected Mass. Eye and Ear individuals had not been reinstalled.
 On April 9 it was determined that it was unlikely that continued monitoring of the computer would lead to its retrieval, and a command was sent by LoJack to the computer permanently disabling the hard drive and rendering any information, including information about affected Mass. Eye and Ear individuals contained on the hard drive, permanently unreadable.
 
 Despite the result of the tracking and destruction noted above, Mass. Eye and Ear is unable to know whether the information about affected Mass. Eye and Ear individuals on the computer was accessed between the date of the theft and March 9.
 
 Should information have been inappropriately accessed, Mass. Eye and Ear does not believe that the information on the laptop regarding the affected Mass. Eye and Ear individuals presents a risk of financial identity theft. It is possible, however, that someone may be able to learn about affected Mass. Eye and Ear individuals’ medical care from the stolen data, and affected individuals may have a risk that someone may attempt to use that information to impersonate them in order to obtain medical care or medications in their name.
 
 In order to protect affected Mass. Eye and Ear individuals, Mass. Eye and Ear is providing information on precautions that they can take to protect themselves against medical identity theft, and has arranged to provide them with one free year of credit monitoring, identity theft insurance and restoration services.
 
 In order to prevent similar breaches from occurring in the future, Mass. Eye and Ear is updating its information security program, including, but not limited to, taking the following specific actions:
 
 Deploying encryption to laptop computers that connect to Mass. Eye and Ear’s computer network, and
 Providing education to Mass. Eye and Ear staff regarding limiting the amount of data stored on laptop computers.
 Mass. Eye and Ear continues its investigation into the information on the stolen computer to determine whether there could be information about additional individuals associated with Mass. Eye and Ear that has not yet been detected. Should additional information be discovered, Mass. Eye and Ear will provide additional notices as appropriate.
 
 “Mass. Eye and Ear apologizes to those affected for any concern, inconvenience, or risk that this incident may cause,” said John Fernandez, Mass. Eye and Ear president and CEO. “We regret that this incident occurred and are taking appropriate steps to protect individuals associated with Mass. Eye and Ear who may have been affected by this breach and to limit or prevent where possible such breaches in the future.”; As the old saying goes, ""no good deed goes unpunished...."" The most recent, published Office for Civil Rights (OCR) HIPAA enforcement action serves as an important reminder that self-reported breaches can and do lead to investigations and enforcement.
 
 Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary was following the HITECH breach notification rules when it reported the theft of an unencrypted laptop in 2010. The laptop contained the protected health information of MEEI patients and research subjects, including prescription and health information. OCR investigated the breach and brought an enforcement action, citing MEEI for a number of HIPAA security rule violations. Not unexpectedly, OCR was focused on laptop security and the security of portable devices generally, which has been an enforcement priority of OCR.
 
 The MEEI enforcement provides other important reminders for covered entities:
 
 1. Avoid breaches and breach notifications which can lead to investigations.
 
 2. Encrypt laptops and other portable devices.
 
 3. Keep track of portable devices.
 
 4. The OCR trend toward seven-figure fines is continuing (the MEEI settlement was $1.5 million).
 
 The read the MEEI resolution agreement, click here. The related OCR press release is here.; HHS' Office for Civil Rights announced that Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and its affiliated physician group, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Associates, agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a HIPAA security-rule violation case.
 
 The $1.5 million settlement with Boston-based Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Associates, collectively known as MEEI, is part of a resolution agreement (PDF) with the Office for Civil Rights. MEEI's alleged violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act's security rule stem from the reported 2010 theft of a laptop computer storing 3,621 patient records, according to HHS.
 
 The Office for Civil Rights alleges that the infirmary and the group not only failed to secure data on the laptop but also failed to comply with several other HIPAA security-rule requirements, including performing “a thorough analysis of the risk to the confidentiality” of individually identifiable patient information stored on the portable device and not “adopting and implementing policies and procedures to restrict access to ePHI to authorized users of portable devices.” The term ePHI refers to electronic protected health information.
 
 “In an age when health information is stored and transported on portable devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones, special attention must be paid to safeguarding the information held on these devices,” Office for Civil Rights Director Leon Rodriguez said in a news release. “This enforcement action emphasizes that compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security rules must be prioritized by management and implemented throughout an organization, from top to bottom.”
 
 The settlement amount is to be paid in three equal installments of $500,000—the first on Oct. 15 of this year and the next two on the same date in 2013 and 2014.
 
 The 17-page resolution agreement also requires the organization “to adhere to a corrective action plan” and permits an independent monitor to make semi-annual assessments of MEEI's compliance with the plan for three years.
 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 required the reporting to HHS of breaches affecting 500 or more individuals and the creation of a public accessible website listing the breaches. There are now 490 such self-reported breach incidents on the list, which is maintained by the Office for Civil Rights. Combined, those breaches exposed the records of more than 21 million individuals, according to the office.
 
 The infirmary is on the list twice. A November 2009 incident involving 1,076 records stemmed from a police investigation into improper use of credit card information that led to the firing of two infirmary employees.; The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Associates Inc. (MEEI), will pay $1.5 million to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for potential violations of the HIPAA Security Rule. In the HHS release, they explain that it wasn't just one issue or misstep that led to the fine, but rather a series of errors and inaction.
 
 ”...such as conducting a thorough analysis of the risk to the confidentiality of ePHI maintained on portable devices, implementing security measures sufficient to ensure the confidentiality of ePHI that MEEI created, maintained, and transmitted using portable devices, adopting and implementing policies and procedures to restrict access to ePHI to authorized users of portable devices, and adopting and implementing policies and procedures to address security incident identification, reporting, and response.”
 
 This was for a breach in February 2010 from an unencrypted laptop that contained ePHI – including patient prescriptions and clinical information – of some 3,621 individuals. If you're doing the math, that's $414 per record. How much would it have cost them to do a risk assessment, or to implement a privacy incident management process? This type of under investment isn't surprising, according to the March 2012 ANSI study titled “The Financial Impact of Breached PHI – A Business Case for Enhanced PHI Security”, organizations are under invested in protecting PHI.
 
 Here are 3 tips organizations can use to reduce the risk of a breach of PHI from mobile devices.
 
 1. Consider geolocation tracking software or services for mobile devices.

 Geolocation tracking software is a low-cost insurance policy against loss or theft that can immediately track, locate, or wipe the device of all data. The majority of healthcare organizations currently lack sufficient resources to prevent or detect unauthorized patient data access, loss or theft. And lost or stolen computing or data devices are the number one reason for healthcare data breach incidents.
 
 2. Brick the mobile device when it is lost or stolen.
 
 Jon A. Neiditz, partner, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP
 
 In the last year, we have seen greater acceptability among employees of “remote wipe” processes that “brick” the entire device when it is lost or stolen, rather than just wiping the encrypted silo of corporate information, for example. The reason that bricking the entire device is more acceptable, in our view, is that personal data is now more frequently backed up in cloud storage, so the bricking of the entire device does not result in data loss, and protects the employee as well as the company. This is the first tip in the context of BYOD programs.
 
 3. Encrypt.
 
 Chris Apgar, CISSP, president and CEO, Apgar and Associates, LLC
 
 All mobile devices and the often-overlooked media, such as USB drives, should be encrypted if they will be used remotely. The cost of encryption is modest and is sound insurance against what has been demonstrated to be a significant risk to healthcare organizations. Most breaches do not occur because of cybercrime. They are associated with people. Even if organizations allow their employees to use their own tablets, laptops and smartphones, they should require encryption if there is a possibility sensitive data will be stored on those devices. Organizations may have a policy prohibiting the storage of sensitive information on personally owned devices, but it is a very hard policy to enforced. At the very least, organiza­tions should require the use of company owned and encrypted portable media.; Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, a Boston-based hospital, agreed to pay $1.5 million to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) earlier this week, settling a HIPAA violation stemming from a 2010 incident.
 
 Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, a Boston-based hospital, agreed to pay $1.5 million to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) earlier this week, settling a HIPAA violation stemming from a 2010 incident.
 The agreement acknowledges that the hospital failed to comply with requirements laid out in HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
 
 Two years ago, while a doctor was travelling abroad, his unencrypted laptop — containing information on roughly 3,500 patients, including patients’ prescriptions and other clinical information — was stolen. According to an alert then, the laptop contained no billing information but did contain patients’ names, addresses, telephone numbers, emails and other identifiable information. While it was never confirmed that any patients had their information breached, the hospital still informed HSS of the incident and an investigation was initiated.
 
 That investigation found the hospital failed to comply with six areas of HIPAA between October 2009 and June 2010. MEEI failed to “implement security measures sufficient to ensure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information” and “conduct a thorough analysis of the risk to the confidentiality of electronic protected health information maintained on portable devices,” among other steps, according to a press release issued on Monday.
 
 In addition to paying the $1.5 million, MEEI must also follow a new Corrective Action Plan (CAP) that outlines steps to ensure it complies with HIPAA, perform risk assessment and train its staff. Mass Eye and Ear must also submit to semi-annual audits for three years, according to a post on HHS.gov.
 
 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee agreed to pay the HHS $1.5 million earlier this year as well. That settlement was in response to a 2009 data breach that compromised the information of a million Blue Cross Blue Shield customers, yet much like MEEI’s incident, there was no clear evidence any of the patients’ information was misused either.
 
 The Government Accountability Office argued in an audit this past summer that the HHS’s Office for Civil Rights (OSR) could be doing a better job regulating its own audits. In its report (.PDF) the GAO claimed the HHS needs to do a better job improving its guidance and oversight.; Another HIPAA data breach settlement has been reached, this time with the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Associates Inc. (MEEI), which will pay $1.5 million to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for potential violations of the HIPAA Security Rule.
 
 HHS officials announced Monday that the settlement also requires MEEI to take corrective action to improve policies and procedures to safeguard the privacy and security of its patients’ protected health information.
 
 The settlement comes in the wake of an investigation conducted by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) following the MEEI Feb. 2010 data breach, where an unencrypted personal laptop containing the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of MEEI patients and research subjects was reported stolen. The laptop contained ePHI – including patient prescriptions and clinical information – of some 3,621 individuals.

 OCR officials say MEEI failed to take necessary steps to comply with certain requirements of the Security Rule, such as conducting a thorough analysis of the risk to the confidentiality of ePHI maintained on portable devices, implementing security measures sufficient to ensure the confidentiality of ePHI that MEEI created, maintained, and transmitted using portable devices, adopting and implementing policies and procedures to restrict access to ePHI to authorized users of portable devices, and adopting and implementing policies and procedures to address security incident identification, reporting, and response. Officials say these failures continued over an extended period of time, demonstrated a long-term disregard for the requirements of the Security Rule.
 
 “In an age when health information is stored and transported on portable devices such as laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, special attention must be paid to safeguarding the information held on these devices,” said OCR Director Leon Rodriguez in an HHS press release. “This enforcement action emphasizes that compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules must be prioritized by management and implemented throughout an organization, from top to bottom.”

 In addition to the $1.5 million settlement, the agreement requires MEEI to adhere to a corrective action plan, which includes reviewing, revising and maintaining policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Security Rule. An independent monitor will conduct assessments of MEEI’s compliance with the corrective action plan and render semi-annual reports to HHS for a three-year period.",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1.0,3526.0,352600.0,1.0,1500000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2012,Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary,MA,INSD,Other,"Police say a Quincy woman who worked at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and her brother used stolen patient information to open fake National Grid accounts that allowed them to dodge paying for electricity.
 
 Fallon and Emmanuel Delacruz of 270 Quarry St. have been charged with identity theft and larceny.
 
 Fallon Delacruz, 25, who also has a Dorchester address, was dismissed from her job after police made her employer aware of the investigation. A police report on file in Quincy District Court says Delacruz worked as a patient financial coordinator.
 
 Mass. Eye and Ear has offered one year of free credit monitoring to potentially affected patients, and sent mail notifications to about 3,600 patients whose Social Security numbers Delacruz was able to access.
 The breach was actually disclosed by Massachusetts Eye and Ear last month. In an April 16th statement on their web site linked from their home page, they wrote:
 
 On March 5, 2012, the Quincy, Massachusetts, Police Department informed Mass. Eye and Ear that they were investigating a Mass. Eye and Ear employee for inappropriately using the names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth of certain individuals, some of whom were believed to be Mass. Eye and Ear patients.
 
 The hospital promptly suspended the employee, who was subsequently dismissed and no longer works at Mass. Eye and Ear. Mass. Eye and Ear determined that four of the individuals identified by the Quincy Police Department are Mass. Eye and Ear patients, and that the employee would have had access to certain personal information about them in order to perform her assigned duties.
 
 The Quincy Police Department has informed us that they are not aware of any credit card theft. Mass. Eye and Ear is also not aware of any inappropriate access to, or use of, medical information.
 
 While Mass. Eye and Ear is only aware of four individuals whose personal information was actually misused, as a precaution we are notifying, by mail, approximately 3,600 patients whose Social Security numbers were available to the former employee in the course of performing her assigned duties.
 
 Mass. Eye and Ear will provide one year of free credit monitoring to potentially affected individuals to protect them against possible harm resulting from this incident.
 
 “Please be assured that we take the protection of our patients’ personal information very seriously,” said Mass. Eye and Ear President and CEO John Fernandez. “We are saddened and disappointed that this former employee appears to have chosen to violate both our trust and that of our patients. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience and concern caused by this incident.”
 
 In order to reduce the chance of similar incidents in the future, Mass. Eye and Ear has taken steps to further restrict access to full Social Security numbers among our staff. Mass. Eye and Ear has been and will continue to perform appropriate background checks as part of the hiring process, and regularly reinforce with our staff the importance of safeguarding patient information.

2009,Massachusetts General Hospital,MA,PHYS,Other,"1. The General Hospital Corporation and Massachusetts General Physicians Organization, Inc. (Mass General) has agreed to pay the U.S. government $1,000,000 to settle potential violations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
 
 Mass General, one of the nation’s oldest and largest hospitals, signed a Resolution Agreement with HHS that requires it to develop and implement a comprehensive set of policies and procedures to safeguard the privacy of its patients. The settlement follows an extensive investigation by OCR.
 
 “We hope the health care industry will take a close look at this agreement and recognize that OCR is serious about HIPAA enforcement. It is a covered entity’s responsibility to protect its patients’ health information,” said OCR Director Georgina Verdugo.
 
 The incident giving rise to the agreement involved the loss of protected health information (PHI) of 192 patients of Mass General’s Infectious Disease Associates outpatient practice, including patients with HIV/AIDS. OCR opened its investigation of Mass General after a complaint was filed by a patient whose PHI was lost on March 9, 2009. OCR’s investigation indicated that Mass General failed to implement reasonable, appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of PHI when removed from Mass General’s premises and impermissibly disclosed PHI potentially violating provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 
 
 This impermissible disclosure involved the loss of documents consisting of a patient schedule containing names and medical record numbers for a group of 192 patients, and billing encounter forms containing the name, date of birth, medical record number, health insurer and policy number, diagnosis and name of providers for 66 of those patients. These documents were lost on March 9, 2009, when a Mass General employee, while commuting to work, left the documents on the subway train. The documents were never recovered.
 
 “To avoid enforcement penalties, covered entities must ensure they are always in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules,” said Verdugo. “A robust compliance program includes employee training, vigilant implementation of policies and procedures, regular internal audits, and a prompt action plan to respond to incidents.”
 
 2. WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The General Hospital Corporation and Massachusetts General Physicians Organization Inc. (Mass General) has agreed to pay the U.S. government $1,000,000 to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced today.
 
 Mass General, one of the nation’s oldest and largest hospitals, signed a Resolution Agreement with HHS that requires it to develop and implement a comprehensive set of policies and procedures to safeguard the privacy of its patients. The settlement follows an extensive investigation by the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which enforces the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires health plans, health care clearinghouses and most health care providers (covered entities) to protect the privacy of patient information through administrative, physical and technical safeguards at all times.
 
 “We hope the health care industry will take a close look at this agreement and recognize that OCR is serious about HIPAA enforcement. It is a covered entity’s responsibility to protect its patients’ health information,” said OCR Director Georgina Verdugo.
 
 The incident giving rise to the agreement involved the loss of protected health information (PHI) of 192 patients of Mass General’s Infectious Disease Associates outpatient practice, including patients with HIV/AIDS. OCR opened its investigation of Mass General after a complaint was filed by a patient whose PHI was lost on March 9, 2009. OCR’s investigation indicated that Mass General failed to implement reasonable, appropriate safeguards to protect the privacy of PHI when removed from Mass General’s premises and impermissibly disclosed PHI potentially violating provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
 
 The impermissible disclosure of PHI involved the loss of documents consisting of a patient schedule containing names and medical record numbers for a group of 192 patients, and billing encounter forms containing the name, date of birth, medical record number, health insurer and policy number, diagnosis and name of providers for 66 of those patients. These documents were lost on March 9, 2009, when a Mass General employee, while commuting to work, left the documents on the subway train that were never recovered.
 
 Mass General also agreed to enter into a Corrective Action Plan (CAP), which requires the hospital to:
 
 Develop and implement a comprehensive set of policies and procedures that ensure PHI is protected when removed from Mass General’s premises;
 Train workforce members on these policies and procedures; and
 Designate the Director of Internal Audit Services of Partners HealthCare System Inc. to serve as an internal monitor who will conduct assessments of Mass General’s compliance with the CAP and render semi-annual reports to HHS for a 3-year period.
 “To avoid enforcement penalties, covered entities must ensure they are always in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules,” said Verdugo. “A robust compliance program includes employee training, vigilant implementation of policies and procedures, regular internal audits, and a prompt action plan to respond to incidents.”
 
 3. The federal Department of Health and Human Services reports here that Massachusetts General Hospital has agreed to pay $1 million to settle claims that it violated patient privacy rules. The department's dry summary:
 
 ""The incident giving rise to the agreement involved the loss of protected health information (PHI) of 192 patients of Mass General’s Infectious Disease Associates outpatient practice, including patients with HIV/AIDS.""
 
 To which must be added: Those records were lost on the Red Line, and never recovered. The account in the settlement posted here offers some painful details:
 
 (1) On March 6, 2009, an MOH employee removed from the MGH premises documents containing protected health information (""PHI""). The MGH employee removed the PHI from the MGH premises for the purpose of working on the documents from home. The documents consisted of billing encounter forms containing the name, date of birth, medical record number, health insurer and policy number, diagnosis and name of provider of66 patients and the practice's daily office schedules for three days containing the names and medical record numbers of 192 patients.
 (2) On March 9, 2009, while commuting to work on the subway, the MGH employee removed the documents contalning PHI from her bag and placed them on the seat beside her. The documents were not in an envelope and were bound with a rubber band. Upon exiting the train, the \1GH employee left the documents on the subway train and they were never recovered. These documents contained the PHI of 192 individuals.
 
 The $1 million settlement agreement specifies that it does not constitute an admission of guilt by Mass. General. The hospital does agree to put in an extensive ""corrective action plan"" to improve privacy protections.

 Mass. General sent over this statement:
 
 Regarding Settlement Agreement with US Dept. of Health and Human Services 
 Massachusetts General Hospital and the Massachusetts General Physicians Organization have entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights related to the loss, in March 2009, of MGH patient encounter billing forms and schedules containing protected health information (PHI) on a Red Line subway train. Under the agreement with HHS, MGH has agreed to implement a corrective action plan during the next three years to enhance protection of PHI when it is physically removed from MGH premises for work purposes. In addition, we agreed to pay $1 million to HHS as part of the settlement.
 
 MGH will be issuing new or revised policies and procedures with respect to (1) physical removal and transport of PHI from MGH premises; (2) laptop encryption; and (3) USB drive encryption. After these policies and procedures are issued, we will be providing mandatory training on them. All members of our workforce must participate in the training and certify that they have completed it.
 We look forward to taking these steps to further our continuing efforts to protect the privacy and security of our patients’ health information.

 Re: Incident Notification 
 Dear Attorney General Foster: 
 Please allow the following to serve as notice of an information security incident involving a limited number of Massachusetts General Hospital (""MGH"") patients' information. 
 On May 26, 2015, we learned that one of our employees inadvertently sent an email, which included some patient information, to an incorrect email address. Several attempts to retrieve the email have been unsuccessful. We immediately began an investigation and determined that the email contained patients' names, lab results, and, in some instances, Social Security numbers. Patients' health insurance policy numbers and financial information were not included in the email. 
 To date, we have no knowledge that any of our patients' information has been used improperly. As a precaution, we are notifying affected patients and offering eligible patients whose Social Security numbers were included in the email a complimentary one-year membership in credit monitoring and identity theft protection services from Experian. 
 To help prevent something like this from happening again, we are updating our processes so that this information will no longer be handled via email. We are also re-educating our workforce regarding the importance of handling patient information securely. 
 MGH is notifying 54 New Hampshire residents in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto, with written notification commencing on July 8, 2015.1 As a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (""HIPAA""), MGH is required to maintain procedures for responding to a breach of security, and notification to New Hampshire residents is being provided in compliance with these procedures as applicable. See N.H. REV. STAT. ANN. 5 359-C:20(V); see also 45 C.F.R. 55 160.103 and 164.400 et seq.
 Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

2019,Massachusetts General Hospital,MA,HACK,Network Server,"1. Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) has discovered computer applications used by researchers in its Department of Neurology have been subjected to unauthorized access. The individual responsible would have been able to access the protected health information of approximately 10,000 patients.
 
 MGH discovered the breach on June 24, 2019 and immediately terminated access to the applications and databases. An investigation was launched, and a forensic investigator was engaged to help determine the nature and scope of the breach. The investigation confirmed that two applications had been subjected to unauthorized access between June 10 and June 16, 2019.
 
 Via the applications, the unauthorized individual would have been able to view information in databases related to specific neurology research studies. The types of information in the databases varied from patient to patient and may have included: Name, marital status, age, date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity, dates of visits and tests, medical record number, diagnoses, treatment information, biomarkers, genetic information, assessments and results, and other research information, including date of death and details of autopsy results. Highly sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, financial information, and health insurance information were not exposed.
 
 Based on the findings of the investigation and the nature of the information exposed, MGH does not believe affected individuals need to take any steps to protect their identities. MGH will conduct a review of its security processes for research programs and will take steps to improve security to prevent similar breaches in the future.
 
 Sonoma Valley Hospital Website Hack Forces Domain Change
 Sonoma Valley Hospital in California has been forced to abandon its three-letter domain name after hackers took control of the domain.
 
 The attack occurred on August 6. Hackers gained access to its svh.com domain and locked out the hospital. The hospital issued a statement saying it had become clear that the domain could not be recovered so the decision was taken to move to a new domain.
 
 Internet connectivity and email accounts have now been migrated to sonomavalleyhospital.org. Patients have been advised to update their contact details for the hospital as emails sent to email addresses on the old domain are not being received.
 
 No patient information was compromised in the attack, but that does not mean patients are not at risk. The individuals who now control the domain could use it in phishing attacks on Sonoma Valley Hospital patients.
 
 According to the hospital, the impact of the domain theft cannot be overstated. The hospital will have to change all printed material, including business cards, letterheads, marketing material, and branding.
 
 2. Mass General Hospital Data Breach Exposes Health Information of 9,900 People
 
 A data breach at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, has experienced a data breach in its neurology department that has exposed the private information of nearly 10,000 people, according to a report published last week in the Boston Globe.
 
 As that newspaper reported on Aug. 22, “’An unauthorized third party’ accessed data in two computer programs used by researchers, Mass. General said.” Further, the Globe’s staff-written report stated, “The breach exposed data about participants in certain research programs, including their names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, and medical histories. Social Security numbers and financial information were not disclosed, according to the hospital.”
 
 The incident occurred in June, the Globe reported, and the hospital has begun notifying people who were affected.”
 
 “As soon as MGH discovered this incident, it took steps to prevent further unauthorized access,” spokesman Michael Morrison said in a statement to the Globe.
 
 The statement posted on the hospital organization’s website on Aug. 22 began, “Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”) is notifying approximately 9,900 individuals of a privacy incident involving MGH’s Department of Neurology in connection with some of its research programs. On June 24, 2019,” the statement said, “MGH learned that an unauthorized third party had access to databases related to two computer applications used by researchers in the Department of Neurology for specific Neurology research studies. MGH immediately began an investigation into the matter. The investigation revealed that between June 10 and June 16, 2019 this unauthorized third party had access to databases containing research data used by certain Neurology researchers.”
 
 Further, the statement read, “The research data varied according to the specific research study and may have included a participant’s first and last name, certain demographic information (such as marital status, sex, race, ethnicity), date of birth, dates of study visits and tests, medical record number, type of study and research study identification numbers, diagnosis and medical history, biomarkers and genetic information, types of assessments and results, and other research information. Some of the data reflects a subject’s participation many years ago. For deceased research participants, the research data included date of death, and, when available, summary autopsy results. The research data did not include any study participant’s Social Security Number, insurance information, or any financial information. The research data did not include any study participant’s address, phone number, or other contact information. The incident did not involve MGH’s medical records systems.”
 
 The statement continued, “As soon as MGH discovered this incident, it took steps to prevent further unauthorized access and restore the affected research computer applications and databases. MGH also engaged a third-party forensic investigator to conduct a review and has contacted federal law enforcement as a precaution. MGH continues to review and enhance the security processes in place for its research programs. MGH is in the process of notifying affected individuals,” the statement added. “MGH does not believe there are any specific steps research study participants should take because of this incident; the data did not involve any Social Security Number, insurance or financial information.”",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,14.0,9900.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2016,Massachusetts General Hospital,MA,HACK,Network Server,"1. MGH hack exposes info of 4,300 patients
 
 A data breach at Massachusetts General Hospital exposed the Social Security numbers and dates of birth of 4,300 patients, the medical center said last night.
 
 The hack happened in February, the hospital said, and the information — which was limited to the center’s dental patients — was stored on a vendor’s computer system.
 
 “That information included patient name, date of birth and Social Security number and, in some instances, may have also included date and type of dental appointment, dental provider name and medical record number,” MGH said in a statement.
 
 The hospital said it reported the breach of Paterson Dental Supply Inc.’s servers to a law enforcement agency which forbade MGH from notifying patients. When law enforcement concluded its investigation May 26, the hospital was allowed to notify patients. Hospital spokesman Michael D. Morrison said in an email that he was “not sure which law enforcement agency was notified.”
 
 However in the statement the hospital said it waited another month, so it could carry out its own investigation.
 
 “MGH is committed to the security of all of the sensitive information maintained by its third-party vendors and is taking this matter very seriously,” the hospital said.
 
 “To help prevent this type of incident from happening again, PDSI took steps to enhance the security of its systems that maintain dental practice data,” it said. “MGH began mailing letters to affected individuals June 29, 2016, and has established a dedicated call center to answer any questions affected individuals may have.”
 
 2. On February 8, 2016, MGH learned that an unauthorized individual gained access to electronic files stored by MGH's trusted third party vendor, Patterson Dental Supply Inc. (PDSI), which were later confirmed to contain some MGH dental practice information. PDSI reported the incident to law enforcement. Thereafter, law enforcement investigators required that any notification to potentially affected individuals and any public announcement of the incident should be withheld while they were conducting their investigation. On May 26, 2016, law enforcement gave permission to notify, and MGH began notification as quickly as possible once it completed its investigation.
 
 MGH's investigation determined that the affected information included patient name, date of birth and Social Security number and, in some instances, may have also included date and type of dental appointment, dental provider name and medical record number. The incident did not involve any unauthorized access to any of MGH's systems or to any files maintained by MGH.
 
 MGH is notifying the sixty-five (65) affected New Hampshire residents on or about June 29, 2016, pursuant to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (""HIPAA""), 45 C.F.R. 164.400-414, in substantially the same form as the letter attached hereto.l MGH is offering the affected individuals, including families of any affected minors, access to a complimentary one-year membership in credit monitoring and identity protection services from Experian. MGH has also established a dedicated call center to assist affected individuals with any questions they may have regarding the incident.
 
 To help prevent this type of incident from happening again, PDSI took steps to enhance the security of its systems that maintain dental practice data.

2010,Mayo Clinic,MN,Theft,Electronic Medical Record,"1. University Medical Center in Tucson has fired three clinical support staff members and a contracted nurse for “inappropriately accessing confidential medical records,” the hospital reported on its website Wednesday.
 
 The records were related to Saturday’s shootings at a Tucson supermarket that killed six and wounded 13 — including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D- AZ).
 
 “We are not aware of any confidential patient information being released publicly,” the hospital said in a statement.
 
 This isn’t the first snooper fired in the past year.
 Mayo Clinic fired an employee who worked in a business center in Arizona for accessing nearly 2,000 patient medical and financial records over a four-year period, the Post-Bulletin of Rochester, MN, reported in September. The employee’s access rights covered all Mayo Clinic patient records at all Mayo sites.
 
 Officials discovered the breach in mid-July. They did not release the name of the healthcare worker.
 
 “This activity took place between 2006 and 2010. An internal investigation was immediately launched. Following a thorough review of the facts, the person was fired,” according to a Mayo statement.
 
 Some facilities use “honeypots” as bait to catch snooping staff members who are in violation of HIPAA. “Honeypots,” also referred to as “honeynuts,” are fictitious medical records that IT monitors to determine if anyone is accessing them.
 
 The terms honeypots and honeynuts derive from the notion that if you want to catch birds, you scatter birdseed. Use these tips regarding honeypots to catch snoopers and respond accordingly:
 
 Gain executive sponsorship. “Using a honeypot implicitly communicates we don’t trust our staff, even though we know that insider snooping is by far the most common cause of privacy or security breaches,” John R. Christiansen, founder of Christiansen IT Law in Seattle, says. You need to have executive sponsorship willing to back you in the event that the use of honeypots results in controversy.
 Get HR buy-in. HR must be looped in to ensure that it will take appropriate action if you catch someone accessing records inappropriately, Christiansen says, adding that “legal counsel should vet the whole program to make sure legal risks are avoided.”
 Conduct a risk assessment of your systems and equipment. Then create records for five media-centric personalities, making them as real as possible. Don’t be too obvious. For instance, Madonna would probably not end up in a central Montana facility.
 Beware of entrapment. Honeypots are analogous to entrapment; they’re bait that wouldn’t work if someone wasn’t predisposed to snooping, Christiansen says, because, as W.C. Fields said, “You can’t cheat an honest man.” Organizations should be certain that staff members know about policies that prohibit snooping and that system configuration prevents accidental access.
 
 2. Mayo Clinic worker fired for snooping on patient records

 The Post-Bulletin, Rochester MN
 
 A Mayo Clinic employee has been fired after accessing patient medical and financial records simply to snoop.
 
 The employee worked in the Mayo financial business unit in Arizona and once worked in Rochester.
 
 An estimated 1,700 patient records were accessed, said Mayo spokesman Chris Gade, noting the employee had access to all Mayo Clinic patient records at all Mayo sites.
 
 The breech was discovered in mid-July.
 
 ""This activity took place between 2006 and 2010. An internal investigation was immediately launched. Following a thorough review of the facts, the person was fired,"" says a Mayo statement.
 
 This is the second high-profile termination at Mayo in the past month. In late August, the clinic announced that a radiologic technologist at Mayo in Jacksonville, Fla., had admitted injecting himself with pain medicine intended for patients, refilling the syringes with saline solution and shooting the resulting mix into patients' IV lines. In the process, the worker allegedly infected at least three patients with hepatitis C.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1640.0,1740.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2019,Mayo Clinic,MN,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"Issue may have led to limited disclosure of patient information through Mayo Clinic app
 
 On Jan. 22, Mayo Clinic learned of a technical issue regarding how some data from its system was being retrieved and then displayed through the Mayo Clinic app. Fewer than 2,000 patients were affected by this issue.
 
 Limited information from one date of service, about one patient, could have been inadvertently viewed by one other patient logged in to the app if certain screens were clicked between May 1, 2015, and Feb. 1, 2019. The information could have included name, age, clinic number or information related to clinical care.
 
 There is no evidence that any personal financial information or social security numbers were accessed or misused. Mayo Clinic does not believe that potentially affected patients need to take any action in response to this incident.
 
 Mayo promptly identified the root cause of the issue and corrected it. Mayo Clinic takes this matter very seriously and will continue monitoring patient records to prevent further incidents from occurring. Mayo Clinic is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its patients.
 
 Mayo Clinic notified affected patients on March 22, 2019; however, Mayo Clinic had out-of-date contact information for some of the affected patients. If you believe you were affected by this incident, you may contact Mayo Clinic at 844-681-7087 (toll-free) between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Central time, Monday through Friday.
 
 Frequently asked questions
 What happened?
 In January 2019 we discovered an issue with the Mayo Clinic mobile patient application that resulted in information for one date of service potentially being viewed by one other patient between May 1, 2015, and Feb. 1, 2019. The information was only viewable to one other patient if that patient logged in to the mobile application, clicked on his/her Lab Results, clicked on a specific Lab Test performed between April 2001 and September 2008, clicked on a Lab Value, clicked on Individual Results, and then viewed the Lab Comment. This issue did not impact the web-based Patient Online Services, nor did it impact the electronic health record. The issue was the result of a table-linking error that resulted in limited information being viewable to the wrong mobile application user. Although we did not have evidence that personal information was seen by others, we did want to inform our patients about the incident.
 
 When did this happen?
 We learned of this issue on Jan. 22, 2019, and began an immediate investigation. By Feb. 2, 2019, we had fully identified the cause of the issue and corrected the issue to ensure patient information was no longer viewable by another user.
 
 How do I know if I was impacted?
 All affected individuals were notified by mailed letters sent on March 22, 2019. If your contact information is current with Mayo Clinic, and you did not receive a letter, you can be assured that you were not impacted by this incident.
 
 What personal information was exposed?
 In most cases, the information included the patient's name, age, date of clinical service and information related to clinical care for one date of service. In rare cases, the information also included the patient's Mayo Clinic number and/or birthdate.
 
 Were social security number exposed?
 No.
 
 Was the information protected/encrypted?
 The patient mobile application is encrypted. Any information that could have been viewable to another user has been removed and linked to the correct patient.
 
 How many people are involved?
 There were 1,902 individuals who were affected by this.
 
 Was the information removed from the server/directory?
 Although the information was not stored in the mobile application, it could have been viewable. We have ensured the information is no longer viewable by another user.
 
 Does this mean someone had access to another patient’s mobile application?
 No, the error was the result of incorrect information being viewable in one other patient's mobile application. This information was not stored in the mobile application and would have only been viewed if that user logged in to the mobile application, clicked on his/her Lab Results, clicked on a specific Lab Test performed between April 2001 and September 2008, clicked on a Lab Value, clicked on Individual Results, and then viewed the Lab Comment, which would have instead contained another patient's information for one date of service.
 
 The user did not have access to another patient's mobile application, nor did the user have access to additional information other than the one incorrect comment.
 
 Can you tell me who viewed the information?
 We do not have evidence that another person actually viewed the information.
 
 Can you tell me exactly what information was viewable?
 In general, the information could have included a patient's name, age, clinic number and/or information related to the patient’s clinical care.
 
 Why didn't you tell affected individuals about the breach of the data sooner?
 Upon learning of the issue, we began an immediate investigation to determine the cause of the incident. Once the cause was identified, we acted immediately to secure all patients' information and accurately identify affected patients.
 
 What is Mayo Clinic doing to prevent this kind of breach from happening again?
 Mayo Clinic takes this matter very seriously, and we put additional technical safeguards in place to prevent future incidents from occurring.
 
 If there are any updates regarding the investigation into the data breach, how will we be notified?
 If additional updates are provided, Mayo Clinic will notify affected individuals through a letter.
 
 Has the information been misused?
 At this time, there is no evidence that there has been any use, or attempted use, of the information exposed in this incident.
 
 What are the risks of identity theft with the information that was exposed?
 The information that may have been viewed by another individual did not contain any financial information or social security numbers. Due to this, we do not believe the information could be used for identity theft purposes.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1424.0,1902.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2015,Mayo Clinic Health System- Red Wing,MN,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"Clinic announces inappropriate access of records
 
 A Mayo Clinic Health System in Red Wing employee who inappropriately accessed more than 600 patients’ records is no longer employed by Mayo Clinic.
 
 According to Asia Zmuda, Mayo Clinic Health System in Cannon Falls, Lake City and Red Wing public affairs manager, the information breach was discovered sometime within the last two months and the employee “accessed patient records beyond the scope of authorized access and assigned job responsibilities.”
 
 Upon discovery of the breach, an internal investigation was launched in which no evidence was found that financial information was accessed or health information was further disclosed, according to a statement released Friday.
 
 Zmuda said the employee’s access became apparent through an internal monitoring system.
 
 “We have proactive monitoring tools in place,” she said. “It was through the proactive monitoring tools that it came to light.”
 
 Zmuda said Friday afternoon Mayo Clinic was in the process of notifying the 601 affected patients.
 
 A confidential call center phone number – 877-797-6091 – is available for patients to address their concerns related to the breach of information.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2190.0,601.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2017,"McLaren Medical Group, Mid-Michigan Physicians Imaging Center",MI,HACK,Network Server,"1. Data breach at Mid-Michigan Physicians compromised patient records
 
 LANSING - A data breach at the Mid-Michigan Physicians clinic earlier this year led to the unauthorized access of patient information, according to a news release. 
 
 McLaren Medical Group, which manages the Mid-Michigan Physicians clinic, said it was notified in March that a Radiology Center computer system was compromised. Letters were mailed to patients on Thursday.
 
 ""Following an extensive investigation, MMG definitively confirmed that information of seven patients was accessed,"" the release reads. ""That investigation did not affirmatively reveal the unauthorized access of any additional records.""
 
 Dave Jones, a spokesman for McLaren Medical Group, told the State Journal about 106,000 patients whose medical information was in the database will be notified, which the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires.
 
 He added that the five-month delay in notifying patients about the data breach was to make sure that an extensive investigation could be completed. 
 
 The medical records that were accessed could contain a patient’s name, date of birth, address, phone number, medical record number, diagnosis and social security number, according to the news release. 
 
 The compromised computer system has been rebuilt with additional security measures, and McLaren Medical Group will provide identity theft monitoring and protection, according to the release.
 
 2. The protected health information of 106,000 current and former patients of the radiology center of Mid-Michigan Physicians has potentially been compromised.
 
 McLaren Medical Group, which manages Mid-Michigan Physicians, has announced that the breach affected a system that stored scanned internal documents such as physician orders and scheduling information, which included protected health information such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, medical record numbers, and diagnoses.
 
 McLaren Medical Group discovered the breach in March this year, although the investigation into the security breach was protracted and notifications were delayed until the investigation was completed.
 
 That investigation confirmed the protected health information of seven individuals was definitely accessed, although potentially, the records of 106,000 patients could also have been viewed as a result of the radiology center’s system being compromised.
 
 McLaren Medical Group says its computer system has been reconstructed with additional security protections in place to prevent further incidents of this nature from occurring. All patients affected by the incident have been offered credit monitoring and identity theft services without charge.
 
 Breach notification letters have now been issued to all individuals potentially impacted by the security breach, although it has taken five months for those notification letters to be sent. The HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires individuals impacted by a PHI breach to be notified as soon as possible, and certainly within 60 days of the discovery of the breach.
 
 This year, Presense Health settled potential HIPAA Breach Notification Rule violations with OCR for $475.,000 after impermissibly delaying the issuing of breach notification letters to patients by one month. It was the first time OCR has settled a case with a covered entity solely for delaying breach notification letters.
 
 Recently, Deven McGraw, deputy director for health information privacy at OCR, confirmed that waiting 60 days to send breach notification letters is a violation of HIPAA Rules. Letters must be sent as soon as possible after a breach. A five-month delay will certainly be scrutinized by OCR and a financial penalty may be deemed appropriate.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,15.0,106008.0,10600800.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 The Medical Center at Bowling Green Notifies Patients of Breach of Protected Health Information
 
 Bowling Green, Ky. (04/28/2010) – The Medical Center is currently notifying 5,418 patients of a breach of personal protected health information. The breach involves the theft of computer equipment from The Medical Center’s Mammography Suite containing information on patients who underwent bone density testing at The Medical Center between 1997 and 2009. We have no reason at this point to believe the device was stolen for the information on it or that any personal information has been released or used.
 
 On April 1, 2010, we discovered that a piece of computer equipment had been stolen from The Medical Center Mammography Suite. Upon learning of the theft, we immediately conducted a comprehensive investigation of the incident, and the theft has been reported to the Bowling Green Police Department.
 
 We have determined the information on the device included each patient’s full name, date of birth, address, medical record number and physician name. Some patients’ records also included information such as social security numbers, weight, height, and menopause age. The information on the hard drive was not encrypted; however, the hard drive was maintained in a locked, non-public, private area.
 
 The Medical Center has stringent policies and procedures in place to protect patient information and takes very seriously its obligation to safeguard the personal health information of its patients. As a result of this breach, steps are underway to further strengthen the security of patient information. We will now archive data to a secure network, which will allow us to eliminate the need for use of a hard drive like the one that was stolen. Additionally, we will ensure that we do not have any other equipment configurations that utilize a portable hard drive containing non-encrypted data.
 
 We regret the incident, and we are committed to prevent future such occurrences. However, affected patients are strongly encouraged to take the following steps recommended by the Federal Trade Commission to prevent any possible misuse of
 personal information. 
 • Monitor accounts and bank statements each month and check credit report on a regular basis.
 • Stay alert for the signs of identity theft, like:
 o accounts you didn’t open and debts on your accounts that you can’t explain.
 o fraudulent or inaccurate information on your credit reports, including accounts and personal information, like your Social Security number, address(es), name or initials, and employers.
 o failing to receive bills or other mail. Follow up with creditors if your bills don’t arrive on time. A missing bill could mean an identity thief has taken over your account and changed your billing address to cover his tracks.
 o receiving credit cards that you didn’t apply for.
 o being denied credit or being offered less favorable credit terms, like a high interest rate, for no apparent reason.
 o getting calls or letters from debt collectors or businesses about merchandise or services you didn’t buy.
 • You may obtain a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion and Experian) by calling 1-877-322-8228; by mail at Annual Credit Report Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281; or by visiting the website: https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp.
 
 The Medical Center is following all of the requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act which includes: notification of the U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services; notification of patients who may have had their personal protected health information accessed by the breach; public disclosure to the local media; and posting information about the breach on The Medical Center’s website.
 
 We have established a toll-free number at 1-877-338-8525 for patients with questions about this matter who live outside the Bowling Green area and who desire to talk directly with The Medical Center’s Privacy Officer. Local residents may reach The Medical Center Privacy Officer at 270-796-2100.

2014,Medical Center of Plano,TX,DISC,Other,"Plano, Texas-based Baylor Regional Medical Center has notified patients their information was compromised when some of the medical center's affiliated physicians responded to phishing emails.
 
 The physicians responded to the phishing emails believing they were from legitimate sources. Some of the physicians who responded to the phishing emails had patient information in their email accounts, according to the notification.
 
 The email accounts contained patients' names, addresses, dates of birth, treating physician, diagnoses, medical record numbers, medical service codes and health insurance information. A few patients' Social Security numbers were also included in the email accounts, according to the notification.
 
  Baylor Regional Medical Center discovered the phishing scheme in February, and immediately began an investigation. The medical center sent letters to affected patients April 25, 2014, according to the notification.
 
  TX: Baylor Regional Medical Center at Plano notifies patients after physicians fall for phishing attempt
 
  Baylor Regional Medical Center at Plano reported a breach to HHS that affected 1,981 patients. The incident, which occurred on January 23, was coded on the breach tool as a “Hacking/IT Incident” with the location of the information identified as e-mail. 
 
 A notice on Baylor’s site explains that this was a phishing incident:
 
 Notice to our Patients Regarding “Phishing” Incident
 Baylor Regional Medical Center at Plano is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of our patients’ personal information. Regrettably, this notice is about an incident involving some of that information.
 
 On February 24, 2014, we learned that “phishing” emails were sent to a small group of affiliated physicians who responded to the emails thinking that they were legitimate internal requests on or after January 23, 2014. By responding to the “phishing” email, the affiliated physicians may have inadvertently created an opportunity for unauthorized access to their email accounts. When we learned of this, we immediately secured the affected email accounts and began an investigation, including hiring an outside forensics expert firm. We undertook a comprehensive review of the affected affiliated physicians’ e-mail accounts and confirmed that some of their emails contained patient information and may have included patient demographic information (for example, name, address, date of birth, or telephone number) and limited clinical information (for example, treating physician and/or department, diagnosis, treatment received, medical record number, medications, medical service code or health insurance information), and in a small number of instances, Social Security numbers. 
 
 We have no evidence that the information in the emails has been used in any way, however, as a precaution, we began sending letters to affected patients on April 25, 2014 and have established a dedicated call center to assist patients with any questions. If you believe you are affected, but have not received a letter by May 12, 2014, please call 1-888-284-6664 Monday through Friday between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. Central Time. 
 
 We deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause our patients. To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, we have re-enforced education with our staff regarding “phishing” emails and are reviewing enhancements to the technical safeguards currently in place to further protect employee email accounts from unauthorized access, such as strengthening user login authentication.
 
 The notice does not explain whether it was within Baylor’s policy for physicians to have unencrypted PHI stored in e-mails in physicians’ e-mail accounts.
 
 Interestingly, at around the same time Baylor doctors were falling for phishing attempts in emails that appeared to be from legitimate internal accounts, doctors at Franciscan Medical Group were falling for phishing attempts where the emails appeared to be from Franciscan Health System’s parent company, Catholic Health Initiative. Were these two phishing incidents related? Neither Franciscan nor Baylor shared more details about the phishing emails or the IP addresses they came from, so it’s hard to know.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0.0,1000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2011,Memorial Health Systems,CO,Unauthorized Disclosure,Desktop Computer,"CO: City employee loses job over Memorial records breach
 
 Barbara Cotter reports on a breach at Colorado Springs Hospital – Memorial Health System:
 
 A Colorado Springs city employee has lost her job for allegedly accessing the records of 2,500 Memorial Hospital patients without cause, and a police investigation is under way, officials reported Monday.
 
 Lori Niell, a nurse with the city’s occupational health clinic, was an authorized user of Physician Link, an encrypted, password-protected electronic records system. But she was not a Memorial employee, and had no medical or other work-related reason for accessing the records of the hospital’s, said hospital spokesman Brian Newsome.
 
 “From my understanding, she was accessing the records when she wasn’t at work,” Newsome said. “She wasn’t doing it as part of her job.”
 
 The hospital is contacting the patients by mail, and is working with the U.S. Office of Civil Rights, which is responsible for investigating patient privacy complaints.
 
 Officials said Niell allegedly accessed the records for “personal” reasons, but did not elaborate. However, Newsome said it did not appear the records were being accessed to commit identify fraud.

 Note: The Gazette edited their story subsequent to me posting this on this blog. If you read the current version of the story, it is somewhat a weird story.
 
 'Psychic' nurse says she is unfairly targeted in hospital records case
 
 A city nurse who lost her job after accessing a Memorial Hospital patient database said she was unfairly targeted because of her psychic abilities.
 
 Lori Niell, who was an occupational health nurse for the city for eight years, said she made her supervisors uncomfortable so they accused her of accessing the encrypted and password-protected Physician Link patient database to find the medical history of patients and use that information to pretend to be a psychic.
 
 “I certainly did not misuse anyone’s medical information because I have integrity,” Niell said.
 “I remain uncharged and unarrested and I expect to remain that way.”
 
 Hospital and city officials contend that Niell accessed the records of 2,500 Memorial Hospital patients without cause. A police investigation is under way. 
 
 She had access to the database but she was not a Memorial employee, and had no medical or other work-related reason for accessing the hospital’s records, said hospital spokesman Brian Newsome.
 
 “From my understanding, she was accessing the records when she wasn’t at work,” Newsome said. “She wasn’t doing it as part of her job.”
 
 The hospital is contacting the patients by mail, and is working with the U.S. Office of Civil Rights, which is responsible for investigating patient privacy complaints.
 
 Officials allege that Niell accessed the records for “personal” reasons, but did not elaborate. However, Newsome said it did not appear the records were being accessed to commit identify fraud.
 
 Niell denied that she had accessed “anywhere close to“ 2,500 records but admitted to the Gazette Monday night that she did use the database for personal reasons, such as to look up the phone number of a friend that she had lost. However, she said that using the database that way is common practice for many in the medical community.
 
 “That’s my crime, but as far as this other allegation, absolutely ridiculous. I wouldn’t dream of doing what they’re accusing me of,” she said. “I guarantee that accessing the database for stuff like that is rampant in the medical community. If you talked to other medical people, you’d find out that it’s pretty damn common.
 
 “If they are going to get me for that, they would have to get a tremendous number of people for that.”
 
 She said she is being investigated because her supervisors were uncomfortable with her psychic ability. Niell, who said she has had three near-death experiences, said she was often able to get a psychic reading from people she was around. Once, she said, she was recognized by the city after correctly warning a patient he was close to a heart attack and advised him to seek immediate treatment.
 
 “The city gave me a plaque for life-saving intervention,” she said. “They liked it when it worked for them but didn’t like it when I made them uncomfortable.”
 
 Niell said her supervisor was looking for a way to fire her after Niell told her about a possible life-threatening condition and the supervisor became angry. Niell admitted she later accessed the database to see if the supervisor heeded her advice and sought treatment.
 
 City spokesman John Leavitt said Niell became a target of an investigation after her supervisor noticed unusual activity on the system, including how many times it was being accessed and from where it was being accessed. Memorial was notified on May 20.
 
 “What I was told is that the patterns were unusual enough to cause some concern, so it seemed prudent to bring it to the attention of Memorial Hospital and ask them to investigate,” Leavitt said.
 
 Colorado Springs Police Department Sgt. Steve Noblitt said police have uncovered a motive but would not divulge it. No arrests have been made. 
 
 Niell said her house was surrounded by police officers with guns drawn on June 22. With a search warrant, they seized two computers, personal papers and more than 20 years of journals she had kept.
 
 “I was using those journals to work on a book, and now they say they can hold onto them for up to two years,” she said.
 
 Niell said that tensions between her and her supervisor became so tense that she resigned on May 20, but city officials told her they would have fired her had she not resigned. She suspects the city made her case public because officials are worried about information she has from a deceased city employee who has been speaking to her from beyond the grave.
 
 “It’s a power play,” she said. “They are showing me how strong they are. I know for a fact that they are pushing me because there is a dead city employee with important information who I have access to.”
 
 She would not elaborate on the name of the dead employee or the type of information she had.
 
 Newsome said Memorial has created a task force to look into beefing up security, and it’s looking into software systems to more quickly alert hospital officials to unusual activity surrounding medical records.

 Memorial Healthcare System in Florida has had another breach, it seems. From the substitute notice they posted on their web site in October:
 
 NOTICE REGARDING AN EMAIL SENT TO PATIENTS REGARDING “BREAKING THE SILENCE” EVENT
 
 Memorial Healthcare System (Memorial) is committed to maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of patient information at all times. We are providing this notice to formally inform a group of our patients about an email we sent to them on September 30, 2014, inviting them to an upcoming event, “Breaking the Silence,” in conjunction with breast cancer awareness month. We accidentally included all invited patients’ email addresses in the “To” section of the email, but recognized the oversight immediately that same day. The email may have suggested care some patients received at Memorial. Some patients may have already received notice of this oversight in an apology email we sent on October 1.
 
 This incident does not affect all Memorial patients, but only the limited number of patients to whom the email invitation was sent. We recalled as many emails as possible. A number of the email addresses were “undeliverable” and not received by anyone.
 
 In an abundance of caution, we began mailing notification letters to affected patients on October 24, 2014. We have also established a dedicated call center to address any questions patients may have. If you believe that you have been affected but do not receive a letter by November 14, please call 1-877-237-3854, Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time (closed on U.S. observed holidays). Please be prepared to provide the following ten digit reference number when calling: 6187101714.
 
 We take this matter very seriously and in response have trained the involved employees on the use of group emails and reminded them of the importance of keeping individual patients’ emails confidential. We will be extending the same training to other employees throughout the organization.
 
 Memorial values the relationship it has with its patients and will continue to provide safe and effective care to those entrusted to our care. We again apologize for this incident.

2014,Memorial Hermann Health System,TX,DISC,Other,"Memorial Hermann confidential patient information accessed
 
 An employee of the Memorial Hermann Health System inappropriately accessed confidential information of more than 10,000 patients over a 6 ½-year period, the chain announced Friday.
 
 The system on Friday began mailing letters notifying affected patients of the breach, one of the largest of its kind in the Texas Medical Center. The accessed data included medical records, health insurance information and, in some cases, social security numbers. It did not include financial information, such as credit cards or bank accounts.
 
 ""We learned that a now former clinical employee accessed patients' electronic medical records outside of the employee's normal job duties from December 2007 to July 2014,"" says the letter. ""We immediately launched a thorough investigation, including hiring outside forensics experts, and suspended the employee's access to the medical records.""
 
 The employee, who was not named, is no longer with the institution, a Memorial Hermann statement said. The statement provided no information about the intent behind the unauthorized access, but a spokeswoman said there is no indication it involved fraudulent purposes.
 
 The matter has been reported as a possible violation of state and federal privacy laws to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Texas Attorney General's office.
 
 The incident is the latest in a seemingly unending string of security breaches in the Medical Center. Since 2010, there have been incidents at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital. Most concerned the loss or theft of computers or computer storage devices.
 
 The biggest breach involved a stolen M.D. Anderson laptop containing information on 30,000 patients, including the specific medical information of 10,000.
 
 In the Memorial Hermann incident, the medical records of all the 10,604 patients was accessed.
 
 The system has established a dedicated call center related to the incident and offered to assist those who may have been impacted, including through a credit monitoring service.
 
 Memorial Hermann officials first learned of the breach on July 7 and finalized its inquiry last week.
 
 An investigation by HHS is automatic in cases where the information of more than 500 patients is breach. If HHS investigators find a pattern of failure to protect patient information, fines of up to $1.5 million for each calendar year in question can be imposed.

2016,Memorial Hermann Health System,TX,DISC,Other,"Memorial Hermann notifies employees of privacy incident
 
 HOUSTON – Memorial Hermann Wednesday announced an incident involving the disclosure of protected health information to select primary care physicians.
 
 The company said the information disclosed was limited to the member's demographic information, that no medical information was disclosed.
 
 A Memorial Hermann employee on May 16 reported potential improper use of her PHI to the Memorial Hermann Privacy Office after the employee received a letter from a PCP she had no prior relationship with regarding the need for an annual physical.
 
 Memorial Hermann said it was determined the PCP received the employee's PHI from MHMD, the Memorial Hermann Physician Network. MHMD received the information from Memorial Hermann Health Solutions.
 
 Memorial Hermann said based on a comprehensive investigation, enrollment files were delivered to a PCP assigned by Health Solutions to 12,061 individual employee group health plan (EGHP) members.
 
 The demographic information disclosed included members' IDs, full names, phone numbers, date of birth and last known mailing addresses.
 
 Memorial Hermann mailed notification letters to the 12,061 members related to the incident and requested that all assigned PCPs who received print-outs of the enrollment files return or certify destruction of the print-outs.
 
 The company said it has no reason to believe any EGHP members' information was seriously compromised or that any member needs to take additional steps to protect him or herself from future harm.
 
 Anyone with questions can call the Memorial Hermann Privacy Office at 713-338-6921 or email the Privacy Office here.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,63.0,12061.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 Houston-based Memorial Hermann Health System is notifying more than 600 patients that their financial information may have been exposed, local CBS affiliate KHOU reports.
 
 The health system discovered May 1 that a clinical administrative employee was improperly using patients' credit and debit card information during the payment collection processes. An internal investigation found the employee processed 604 credit, debit and eCheck payments during his or her tenure, which began Sept. 24, 2018.
 
 Memorial Hermann immediately halted the employee's access to patient information when they discovered the incident. The employee was fired May 3.
 
 Patients who were affected can receive free credit monitoring services from the health system. Memorial Hermann told KHOU that if a patient does not receive a notice that means he or she was likely not affected.
 
 Memorial Hermann worker accused of stealing patients' credit card numbers to pay rent
 
 HOUSTON – A Memorial Hermann employee has been suspended after he was charged with credit and debit card abuse.
 
 He’s accused of stealing patients information to pay for rent, buy food and purchase rides to work.
 
 According to Harris County court records, 26-year-old Elliott Phylow admitted to Harris County Precinct Four constables that he used credit card information from patients who went to Memorial Hermann Hospital for care.
 
 He said he works as a patient care representative for the Memorial Hermann Healthcare System.
 
 He admitted to using several credit cards to “arrange rides with Uber and LYFT so he could go back and forth to work,” according to the court document.
 
 It goes on to say he admitted to using the cards to order food from various restaurants including Papa John’s and Outback Steakhouse.
 
 A patient told authorities he did not authorize payment to an apartment complex in Spring in February for $1,292.56 and again in April for $1,234.37. It’s the same complex where Phylow reportedly lives.
 
 The same patient also said he did not authorize charges for Uber and Lyft and “provided copies of his Capitol One Credit Card and highlighted the charges that he did not authorize,” which totaled $2,824.79.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,240.0,604.0,60400.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 GULFPORT, Miss. —Memorial Hospital at Gulfport has notified approximately 1,500 patients of an inadvertent disclosure of information, including patient names and internal (Memorial) encounter numbers, that was discovered during a routine internal audit. No financial information, Social Security numbers, diagnoses, symptoms, nor other demographic information was disclosed. 
 
 The disclosure occurred in connection with the transmission of information within the hospital that was inadvertently sent to a single, external email address as a result of a clerical input error. The error was immediately corrected upon discovery. The information sent by email was encrypted and would require a unique password to open. 
 
 Additionally, Memorial has been unable to confirm whether the email address was operational, or whether the information was received by the unintended recipient. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, Memorial has reported the matter to the Department of Health and Human Services.
 
 ""We take the security and privacy of our patients' information very seriously and will continue to use our best efforts to prevent any unintended disclosures in the future,"" said Gary G. Marchand, Memorial President/CEO.

A spokesperson from the hospital said someone gained access to an employee’s email account on December 6, 2018, which enabled them to access patients names, dates of birth, health insurance, and other information. The hospital learned of the unauthorized access 11 days later.

A statement sent to the media from Memorial Hospital said, “MHG immediately took steps to secure the account and began an investigation, which determined that patient information was contained in the email account and may have included patients’ names, dates of birth, health insurance information and/or information about medical care received at MHG. A limited number of Social Security numbers were also contained within the email account.”

Patients who may be affected began receiving letters this week from the hospital offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection. Memorial Hospital recommends that patients review statements they receive from their health care providers and health insurers. If they see charges or services not incurred or received, they should contact the insurer or provider immediately.

The incident is still under investigation and even more patients could be notified in the coming weeks. If you have questions, you can call the hospital at 1-833-231-3353, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.

Credit should be given to Memorial Hospital of Lafayette County in that it didn’t bury its breach notification letter, posted by PHIPrivacy.net here, on its website and instead it’s on the middle of its home page. The notice says that there was an erroneous setting in the vendor’s system and the system generated a number of “zero balance” or “aged account balance” statements relating to care provided at the hospital since 2001 and these bills were sometimes sent to wrong or outdated addresses.
The statements did not contain sensitive or detailed information.  In fact, the only information relating to treatment at the hospital is the patient’s name and account number, date(s) of service, and the charges associated with each date of service.  The statements also included the name, address and identification number for the guarantor on the account.  Other personal information, such as Social Security number, date of birth, and specific health conditions, were not included in the disclosure.

Memorial Hospital went on to say that the vendor’s errors have been corrected and patients will receive an account statement only if there is a balance owed, or if the account was paid to zero since the last statement. “Memorial Hospital of Lafayette County places an extremely high priority on privacy and security of health information and regrets that this incident occurred,” the statement read.",0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,10.0,6000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2017,Mercy Health Love County Hospital and Clinic,OK,Theft,Laptop,"A Mercy Health Love County Hospital breach has potentially impacted more than 13,000 patients in Oklahoma.
On June 23, 2017, the hospital discovered an employee had stolen a laptop computer and paper records from a storage unit used by the hospital. According to the breach notice issued by Mercy Health, the records of 10 patients were taken from the storage unit along with the laptop.

The theft of PHI was initially investigated by the Love County Sheriff’s Office. That investigation revealed the former employee had used the stolen information to fraudulently obtain credit cards in the patients’ names. A second individual is also understood to have been involved.

While Mercy Health had up to 60 days to notify patients of the breach under HIPAA Rules, all ten patients were notified immediately. Mercy Health is working with the Love County Sherriff’s Office, the United States Postal Services, and the U.S. Secret Service which are all investigating the incident.

Mercy Health said in its breach notice, “Although there is no evidence that files belonging to patients aside from the ten patients originally identified were accessed or acquired without authorization, Mercy is nonetheless informing the public of the incident.” All affected patients have been offered 12 months of credit monitoring and identity theft repair services without charge.

Mercy Health Love County Hospital and Clinic Administrator Richard Barker said, “We are taking steps to secure all patient information to prevent anything similar from happening.”

While it would appear that the records of only 10 patients were stolen, a report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights indicates a breach has been experienced involving 13,004 paper/film records.

It is currently unclear whether the storage unit contained the records of 13,004 patients, but only 10 patients’ files were taken, or if this is a separate incident.

“Upon careful investigation, we found no indication or evidence that the information was either accessed or misused.’’

For most of Mercy patients, Rotter said the information at risk potentially included names, home addresses, email addresses, insurance information and dates of birth.

In some cases, she said sensitive diagnosis information was also potentially accessible, and in some other situations, Social Security number information was vulnerable.

2017,Mercy Hospital Logan County,OK,PHYS,Other,"Robert Ashley Bond of Thackerville, Oklahoma recently pled guilty to charges over his alleged involvement in a 2017 healthcare data breach. 
The United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Oklahoma announced that Bond pled guilty to Conspiracy To Commit Wire Fraud and pled guilty to Aggravated Identity Theft.
“The Indictment alleged that from in or about April 2017 and continuing until on or about June 23, 2017, the Defendant, and others, knowingly conspired, agreed and confederated to execute and attempt to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud M.A., L.L., O.L., C.M., J.P., K.P., S.D., K.M., and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to obtain money and property by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises which the Defendant transmitted or caused to be transmitted by means of wire communications in interstate commerce,” the Eastern District of Oklahoma Attorney’s Office stated.Bond and Lane Edward Miller were both accused of felony charges stemming from a reported Mercy Health Love County Hospital and Clinic data breach. Miller previously worked at Mercy Love, and allegedly stole patient medical records.

Mercy Health explained in an earlier statement that the information gathered included patient names and Social Security numbers and was used to fraudulently obtain credit cards.

“We are very upset that this occurred, as we take the privacy and security of our patient information very seriously,” Mercy Health Love County Hospital and Clinic Administrator Richard Barker stated. “We are taking steps to secure all patient information to prevent anything similar from happening again, and we will do all we can to see that the criminals are held accountable.”

KXII Fox News 12 reported on the initial breach in 2017, saying that medical records were taken from a storage building.

Barker told the news source that the hospital and the community were violated in the incident.

""These buildings are secured in various ways, with three digit security combinations, and these combinations are changed periodically,"" Barker said. ""They weren't changed soon enough to prevent this theft, and I take responsibility for that.""

He added that Mercy Health’s security measures “changed dramatically” after the incident to ensure that it does not happen again.  

The hospital indicated that 10 patients were impacted by the data breach. A breach report submitted to OCR on September 20, 2017 though said a theft of “paper/films” affected 13,004 individuals.

A similar case was brought to a District of Puerto Rico Federal Grand Jury in February 2017, when the owner of a durable medical equipment company and three physicians were charged with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, healthcare fraud and aggravated identity theft. 

In that case, the defendants allegedly worked to defraud Medicare from on or about February 20, 2007 through on or about July 18, 2013. Specifically, the charges reportedly led to fraudulent invoices in excess of approximately $1.2 million to Medicare.

“The federal charges stem from an alleged scheme whereby Javier Efraín Siverio-Echevarría, as owner of Equipomed Care Corp., a durable medical equipment company with offices in Hatillo, Puerto Rico, would use the personal identifying information of Medicare beneficiaries, to invoice Medicare for durable medical equipment that these beneficiaries did not need or to whom the equipment would not be delivered,” the US Department of Justice stated.  

The Medicare system puts trust in physicians to ensure that patients receive necessary care and with the proper equipment, US Attorney Rosa E. Rodriguez-Velez said in a statement.

“The charges unsealed today allege that three physicians violated their responsibility to their patients and instead facilitated the means for an equipment company to bill over a million dollars to Medicare for equipment not delivered or not medically necessary,” she explained. “These charges are yet another example of the Department of Justice’s determination to hold those who choose to steal from Medicare for personal gain accountable for the harm they inflict on groups of the most vulnerable individuals in our society: the sick, the elderly and the disabled.”",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,629.0,62900.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2015,"Meritus Medical Center, INC",MD,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"he Meritus Medical Center (MMC) in Hagerstown, Maryland has started issuing breach notification letters to 1, 029 patients after a “privacy incident” was discovered in which patient names and other Personally Identifiable Information (PII) were exposed along with healthcare information and Social Security numbers, according to a report in the Herald Mail.
 Dates of birth, patient gender and medical record numbers were potentially viewed along with healthcare data such as medical test results. Not all individuals had their Social Security numbers compromised, as this data was only stored on a limited number of individuals. MMC has confirmed that no financial information was exposed in the data breach.
 Breach Notification Letters Sent
  
 HIPAA-Covered Entities often delay the issuing of breach notices to patients to enable a full breach investigation to be conducted, which can take some time to complete. This proved to be the case with Meritus Medical Center; although according to a statement released by a MMC spokesperson, Mary Rizk, the breach notice letters were sent “as soon as possible”.
 The investigation into the data breach was commenced “as soon as the incident was discovered by our security/privacy audit.” The investigation did show that patient information was accessed by a member of staff of the Business Associate, although it does not appear that any of that information was used inappropriately, so the risk of identity theft or fraud is perceived to be low.
 Because the estimated level of risk to patients is relatively low, no credit monitoring services have been offered; although patients have been advised that they should check their Explanation of Benefits statements for any sign of fraudulent activity, Credit reports should also be obtained from Equifax, Experian and TransUnion and checked on an annual basis. By law, a free credit report can be obtained once every 12 months from each of the three credit bureaus by American citizens.
 Data Breach Caused by an Employee of a Business Associate
  
 The data breach was identified following a routine audit of the medical center’s Business Associates (BA) on May 4, 2015. The audit revealed that one of the company’s BAs – a “trusted vendor” – had accessed patient information which was deemed to fall outside of the BAs work duties. Between July 2014 and April 2015 the data of 1,029 patients appears to have been accessed and what MMC refers to as “limited information” was potentially viewed by an employee.
 As soon as the breach was discovered MMC terminated the access rights of the employee to prevent any further information from being compromised. The BA has assured MMC that the employee responsible has been disciplined for the incident. It is not known whether the individual in question is still working for the BA.
 To reduce the risk of future data breaches caused by BAs, “[MMC] will continue to work toward further strengthening controls related to vendor access to patient information and enhancing our monitoring capabilities with regard to vendor access.”
 OCR to Scrutinize HIPAA-Compliance in Second Round of HIPAA Audits
  
 The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has been closely monitoring Business Associates for HIPAA violations, since BAs were brought under HIPAA Rules following the introduction of the Omnibus Rule. BAs found not to have implemented the necessary standards to ensure healthcare data is protected can be fined directly by the OCR. The penalties can be viewed here.

 On May 13, 2013, Texas Health Fort Worth learned that a portion of the microfiche we had provided to Shred-it for secure destruction services had been discovered in a park on May 11, 2013 by a local resident who immediately reported the incident to the Dallas Police Department and observed the microfiche until the police had arrived. In addition, three sheets of microfiche were found during that general time frame in two other public areas. Texas Health Fort Worth recovered the microfiche and began a thorough investigation. Our investigation determined that Shred-it had not destroyed the microfiche in accordance with our contract requirements.
 The records on the microfiche may have included patient names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, clinical information, health insurance information and in some instances Social Security numbers. We have no knowledge that any of the information included on the microfiche has been accessed or used inappropriately. Furthermore, microfiche is no longer commonly used, and specialized equipment is needed to read the information it contains.
 This incident does not affect all Texas Health Fort Worth patients only those who were admitted to the hospital between 1980 and 1990.
 Shred-it advised us that the microfiche remaining in its possession was disposed of, however, out of an abundance of caution, we began sending letters to affected patients on July 11, 2013.

Therefore, we regret to inform you of an incident that resulted in the possible unauthorized disclosure of your protected health information (PHI), including such information as your name, medical record number, medical diagnosis, physician’s name, and limited sensitive medical information. Although we have no evidence that your PHI was inappropriately used, we are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to inform you of this incident in writing. We also want to assist you by providing you with the steps that you can take to protect yourself from any harm that may result from this incident. DESCRIPTION OF INCIDENT: By way of background, HHC has implemented an information governance and security program that, among other things, monitors and detects all email communications that contain PHI and other confidential information that are sent outside of HHC’s information systems without proper authorization. The incident in question, which occurred on January 15, 2015, was discovered on March 31, 2015 when, in the course of HHC’s monitoring of outgoing emails, we identified an email that contained PHI, including yours, which a Metropolitan employee improperly sent from his HHC email account to his personal email account. While there is no indication that the employee improperly used the information contained in the email, its transmission was unauthorized and certainly not condoned by Metropolitan. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of this incident and advising you of the actions that we have taken and the ones that we recommend you consider taking to protect yourself from any possible adverse effects that could arise as a result of this incident. WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN RESPONSE TO THE BREACH: Metropolitan has promptly taken a number of steps in response to this incident. First, we interviewed the responsible Metropolitan employee and examined his HHC email account to ensure that we identified all the sites to which the email and spreadsheets were sent. We also reviewed the employee’s personal email account, and were present to ensure that the employee deleted the email and spreadsheets from his personal email account. Second, to help relieve concerns and restore confidence following this incident, we have secured the services of Kroll to provide identity theft protection at no cost to you for one year. Kroll is a global leader in risk mitigation and response, and their team has extensive experience helping people who have sustained an unintentional exposure of confidential data.

We have also instituted the automatic blocking of email communications containing PHI and other confidential information from being sent from HHC’s information systems to any site or entity outside of the HHC security network unless for a legitimate business purpose. Fourth, the Metropolitan employee responsible for this improper transmission has been terminated from his position by HHC. WHAT YOU CAN DO: In addition to enrolling in credit monitoring services, below are some additional steps you may wish to take to protect yourself from potential harm that may arise from this incident: 1) Order a free credit report. Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report from each of the three national consumer reporting companies (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) once every twelve months. After you receive your credit report you should review it to see if it contains activity that you do not recognize, such as accounts that you have not opened, or debts that you did not incur. If you discover information in your credit report that you believe to be fraudulent, contact the credit reporting company to remove this information. You may obtain your free credit report online at www. annualcreditreport.com or by telephone at 1-877-322-8228. Although you may request credit reports from all three credit reporting companies at the same time, another strategy would be to order from one company immediately and from the other two over a period of weeks or months to see if any unrecognized activity appears over time. 2) Place a credit alert on your consumer credit files. Call the toll-free number of any one of the three major credit reporting companies listed below to place a free 90-day fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent an identity thief from opening accounts in your name. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your fraud alert, the other two credit bureaus will automatically be notified to place alerts on your credit report. Equifax: 1-800-525-6285/ www.equifax.com/ P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241 Experian: 1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742) / www.experian.com / P.O. Box 9532, Allen TX 75013. TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289 / www.transunion.com / Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O. Box 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834-6790 3) Monitor your account activities. Read your health insurance statements of services promptly upon receiving them to confirm that they are accurate. Also, make sure that any health care bills that you receive are accurate. Be concerned if you receive statements for medical services you did not receive. If you believe you are a victim of medical identity theft, you may make a report to the New York City Police Department at your local precinct or by calling 311. 4) Request access to your medical record and, if appropriate, file a request to amend your record. You may wish to review your medical record to determine whether your information has been compromised. Depending on your review, you may file a request to amend your record to correct any information that you believe does not appropriately apply to your medical record. To review, copy or make changes to your medical record, please contact the Metropolitan Privacy Officer, Christopher Roberson, or the HHC Corporate Privacy and Security Officer, William Gurin, at the phone numbers provided below.

 OS first discovered the unauthorized email access on December 21. Upon discovery, officials said they quickly changed the employee’s user credentials and launched an investigation with help from an outside forensic team.
 
 The investigation revealed the hacker gained access using credentials they obtained when an employee fell for a phishing email on October 15, 2018 – more than two months before it was discovered.
 
 On February 20, the investigation concluded, and on April 1, they confirmed the patients affected by the hack. The compromised accounts contained a range of patient data, including names, dates of service, hospital encounter numbers, and account balances. A small number of patient Social Security numbers, in the form of insurance numbers, were also breached.
 
 OS began notifying the impacted providers on May 2, which included Sauk Prairie Healthcare, Tahoe Forest Health District, Sparta Community Hospital, and the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Spectrum Health Lakeland was also impacted by the OS breach, and recently began notifying about 1,000 patients that their data was potentially compromised. Galena, Illinois – May 3rd, 2019 – Midwest Medical Center has been notified that a vendor
 providing claims management related services to Midwest Medical Center had one of its email
 accounts unknowingly accessed by an unidentified third party late last year.
 The breach of the email account of OS Inc. occurred between October 15, 2018 and December 21,
 2018. OS, Inc. notified Midwest Medical Center about this breach on March 8, 2019.
 OS Inc. provides claims management and reporting services to various health care providers,

 activity occurring within an OS Inc. employee’s email account and, with the assistance of forensics
 experts, determined that an unauthorized user obtained credentials to log-in to the email account
 through a “phishing” email attack. OS Inc. subsequently informed law enforcement and, with the
 assistance of the forensics experts, launched an investigation to determine the size and scope of
 the attack, as well as the number of people potentially impacted.
 Neither OS Inc. nor the forensics experts it worked with were able to determine whether any emails
 or email attachments were accessed by the unauthorized actor. OS Inc. identified approximately
 8,000 patients whose protected health information was contained within an email or email
 attachment that may have been accessible during the timeframe in question. OS Inc. has begun
 notifying, by letter, those Midwest Medical Center patients who were affected. The protected health information of Midwest Medical Center patients that may have been accessed
 through the OS Inc. email account includes the patient’s name, medical record number, encounter
 number, admission date, discharge date and, in some instances, date of birth. For a limited number
 of patients, information may have included a subscriber number. There is no evidence that any
 Midwest Medical Center patient’s Social Security number, driver’s license number, banking or
 credit card information, or other financial information was impacted. Further, there is no evidence
 that any Midwest Medical Center patient treatment information, diagnoses, lab results, or
 medications was impacted.
 Midwest Medical Center takes this situation seriously and is committed to protecting the privacy
 of its patients. Midwest Medical Center is working with OS Inc. to ensure that OS Inc. increases
 its protections to guard against any future unauthorized disclosure. Midwest Medical Center has
 also strengthened its internal procedures relating to the release of patient information.

 Hackers stole data from Community Health Systems in Franklin, Tenn. The company operates 206 hospitals nationwide, including 10 in Oklahoma.
 
 The thieves obtained patient names, addresses, birth dates, telephone numbers and Social Security numbers. The data did not include credit card or medical information, the company reported Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 Patients from all affected hospitals or medical centers will be notified and offered identity-theft protection services, Community Health Systems said.
 
 The company and cybersecurity firm Mandiant believe the cyberattack occurred in April and June of this year and was carried out by a group in China using sophisticated malware. The FBI is investigating.
 
 The breach affects 4.5 million patients who received treatment or were referred to a Community Health Systems hospital in the past five years. In addition to Deaconess, the company has nine facilities in Oklahoma: Integris Blackwell Regional Hospital; Integris Clinton Regional Hospital; Integris Marshall County Medical Center; Integris Mayes County Medical Center; Integris Seminole Medical Center; Medical Center of Southeastern Oklahoma in Durant; Midwest Regional Medical Center in Midwest City; Ponca City Medical Center; and Woodward Regional Hospital.
 
 The hospitals with the Integris name are no longer operated by Integris Health of Oklahoma City. The data from those five facilities appear to be safe, an Integris spokeswoman said.
 
 A Midwest Regional Medical Center spokesman says its patient information was not affected.
 
 “Although we already had industry specific standards in place to protect the privacy of electronic patient data, we have implemented additional actions to safeguard our computer systems and to protect against this type of intrusion in the future,” said Matt Henson, a spokesman for the Midwest City hospital.
 
 The status of patient data at the Durant, Ponca City and Woodward hospitals was not clear Monday evening.
 
 Andy Fosmire, managing director of the Rural Health Association of Oklahoma, said the breach won’t affect the quality of care provided by the hospitals. “What it will do is affect patients’ trust and ability in the hospitals to maintain the security and privacy of their information,” he said.

On January 7, 2013, Suffolk Superior Court approved consent judgments pursuant to which five entities agreed to collectively pay $140,000 to settle allegations that they mishandled and improperly disposed of medical records containing personal information and protected health information. The settlement amount includes civil penalties, attorneys’ fees and an allocated amount for a data protection fund to support efforts to improve the security and privacy of sensitive health and financial information in Massachusetts. A copy of the complaint and corresponding consent judgments are attached here. 
 
 The medical records contained information relating to more than 67,000 residents, and included names, Social Security numbers, health insurance information and medical diagnoses that were not redacted or destroyed before they were discarded at a local transfer station. The five entities include Goldthwait Associates, which provided medical billing services, in addition to four pathology groups that worked with Massachusetts hospitals and medical centers.
 
  The AGO alleged that Goldthwait Associates mishandled and disposed of medical records containing personal information and protected health information that it received from the pathology groups. In addition, the AGO alleged that the four pathology groups failed to have appropriate safeguards in place to protect the personal information they provided to Goldthwait Associates, and did not take reasonable steps to select and retain a service provider that would maintain appropriate security measures to protect such confidential information. The complaint alleged that Goldthwait Associates violated the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, M.G.L. c. 93A; the Massachusetts Data Disposal and Destruction Act, M.G.L. c. 93I; and the Massachusetts Security Breach Act and its corresponding regulations, M.G.L. c. 93H/201 CMR 17.00. In addition, the complaint alleged that the four pathology groups violated the Massachusetts Security Breach Act and its corresponding regulations, M.G.L. c. 93H/201 CMR 17.00; and HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, 45 C.F.R. §§ 160 to 164.
 
 Unlike the other data security violations prosecuted by the AGO where the settling entity was required to disclose a data breach to the AGO, this matter first became public in 2010 when a Boston Globe photographer was discarding his own garbage at the transfer station and noticed a large stack of paper which, upon closer inspection, he discovered to be medical records. It thereafter became apparent that the owners of Goldthwait Associates had recently retired and, in an effort to dispose of their records as cheaply and quickly as possible, had hired their son to discard the documents at a local transfer station. The complaint stated that Goldthwait’s “failure to institute and implement reasonable data security measures to protect the confidentiality of protected health and personal information entrusted to Goldthwait, and instead allow an untrained third-party to dispose of the documents at a dump, resulted in a serious violation of patient privacy and violations of state consumer protection and data security laws.”
 
 Since the regulations went into effect in March 2010, the AGO has sent a consistent message of enforcement. In a statement announcing the January 7th settlement, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley stated: “Personal health information must be safeguarded as it passes from patients to doctors to medical billers and other third party contractors . . . . We believe this data breach put thousands of patients at risk, and it is the obligation of all parties involved to ensure that sensitive information is disposed of properly to prevent this from happening again.”
 
  July 2010 a Boston Globe photographer discovered a knoll of medical records at the Georgetown Transfer Station. Goldthwait Associates, a medical billing practice, tossed the records of more than 67,000 Massachusetts residents at the public dump when they closed shop in May 2010. The records included names, Social Security numbers, health insurance information and medical diagnoses.
 
 The AG alleged that the owners of Goldthwait Associates improperly disposed of medical records and in doing so violated the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, the Massachusetts Data and Disposal and Destruction Act, and the Massachusetts Security Breach Act (including 201 CMR 17.00). The pathology groups were charged with “failing to have appropriate safeguards in place to protect the personal information they provided to Goldthwait Associates” and not taking reasonable steps to retain a service provider that had appropriate security measures in place to protect personal information (PI) and protected health information (PHI). The groups were alleged to be in violations of the Massachusetts Security Breach Act and HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.
 
 The complaint outlines steps that the groups did not take during their relationship with Goldthwait, which can serve as a to-do list when onboarding new vendors:
 
  inquire about the vendor’s methods for ensuring adequate safeguards for protecting PI and PHI;
  inquire about the vendor’s methods for disposing of PI and PHI;
  inspect the vendor’s facilities;
  request a copy of the vendor’s policies and procedures or contracts that detail the vendor’s method for disposing of PI and PHI;
  verify that employees of the vendor who come into contact with PI or PHI are adequately trained regarding the appropriate methods for handling or disposing of such information.
 The settlement agreement requires each pathology group to vet all business associates, ensuring they have a written information security plan and the practices described are sufficient to comply with the groups’ obligations to protect personal information and PHI. The groups must also execute business associate agreements before disclosing any PI or PHI to service providers. AG Coakley said, “Personal health information must be safeguarded as it passes from patients to doctors to medical billers and third-party contractors.”
 
 Gagnon, the owner of Goldthwait Associates, told news sources that some of the groups were his clients for over 25 years, which may explain why they failed to have formal agreements in place. This settlement underscores the importance of reviewing the practices of your vendors (even if your best friend owns the company) and signing agreements with them that cover the protection of PI and PHI.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,60.0,19750.0,0.0,1.0,15000.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
2011,Mills-Peninsula Medical Center,CA,INSD,Other,"A mailroom employee at Mills-Peninsula Medical Center in Burlingame, Calif., stole medical records of roughly 1,500 patients, according to a San Francisco Chronicle report.
 
 The report said the employee, who has been fired, conducted the thefts between Nov. 2009 and Sept. 2010, and most of the records contained patient names and diagnostic test results. Fifteen stolen records included patient addresses and either insurance identification of Social Security numbers.
 
 Hospitals officials weren't aware of the thefts until this past June when a relative of the mailroom employee discovered the medical records and returned them to MPMC, the report said. The hospital will pay for year of identity theft service for affected patients.
 Former Employee of CA's Mills-Peninsula Health Faces Charges of Embezzlement, Forgery for Medical Records Theft
 - Monday, October 24th, 2011 Print | Email
  A former employee of Burlingame, Calif.-based Mills-Peninsula Health Services who took home 1,500 patient records is being charged with embezzlement and forgery, according to a San Mateo Daily Journal report.
 
 Katherine Asimos, who worked in the hospital mailroom, allegedly took the documents between Nov. 2009-Sept. 2010. She was sent a notice to appear today for arraignment on five counts of forgery, embezzlement by a caretaker and embezzlement of records. District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said the charges are misdemeanors because medical records do not have a monetary value, according to the report.

2010,Milton Hospital (via Goldthwait Associates),MA,PHYS,Other,"Four Massachusetts hospitals, including Milton Hospital and Caritas Carney Hospital in Dorchester, are investigating how thousands of patient records ended up at a public dump in Georgetown.
 
 Four Massachusetts hospitals, including Milton Hospital and Caritas Carney Hospital in Dorchester, are investigating how thousands of patient records, some containing Social Security numbers and sensitive medical information such as the results of tests for cancer, ended up at a public dump possibly in violation of state law.
 
 The unshredded records were discovered July 26 in Georgetown by a photographer for The Boston Globe who was dropping off his own trash at the town transfer station. The newspaper alerted the hospitals.
 
 Under state law, medical records and documents containing personal identifying information must be disposed of in a way that protects privacy. That usually means shredding or burning.
 
 The dumped records were from the two local hospitals and hospitals in Milford and Holyoke and their pathologist groups, and most were dated 2009. All contract with the same billing company, Goldthwait Associates, which was supposed to dispose of the records. That company was sold to new owners in June.
 
 South Shore Hospital in Weymouth last month announced that personal data on about 800,000 people have been missing for months.
 
 The data were removed from the hospital on Feb. 27, but it wasn’t until June that the hospital learned they were missing. The information had been gathered over 14 years and was on back-up computer files that were supposed to be destroyed.

2013,"Mission Hospital , St. Joseph Health",CA,PORT,Other,"$7.5M Healthcare Data Breach Settlement for St. Joseph Health
 The settlement revolved around a healthcare data breach from 2012 where PHI was made available via internet search engines.
 
  By Sara Heath
 
 March 15, 2016 - A class-action lawsuit against St. Joseph Health System for a 2012 healthcare data breach has been resolved, resulting in SJHS paying the class members $242 each, splitting the total settlement check of $7.5 million.
 
 healthcare-data-breach-lawsuit
 According to court documents, this settlement notes not only the $7.5 million settlement, but also $3 million set aside for patients who may apply for up to $25,000 each if they suffered identity theft. The documents also show that SJHS has also invested a considerable amount of money into notifying patients of the data breach, complying with federal security regulations, offering free credit monitoring for potentially affected individuals, and new and additional security measures.
 
 This class action lawsuit was the result of a healthcare data breach that reportedly occurred at SJHS between 2011 and 2012 when PHI was somehow made searchable via internet search engine. This breach was discovered by one of the class members, Danna Graewingholt, who found her health information was available online.
 
 After consulting with a lawyer, Graewingholt notified SJHS’s legal department. The hospital then uncovered the breach, finding that potentially breached information included patient names, medical data such as body mass index, smoking status, blood pressure, lab results, diagnoses, medication allergies, demographic information, and advance directive status.

 UPMC Health Data Breach Lawsuit Dismissed
 The data came primarily from inpatient records for individuals receiving care between February and August of 2011.
 
 The total number of potentially affected individuals spanned a number of SJHS’s facilities, including Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, St. Jude Hospital, Queen of the Valley Medical Center, Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, Petaluma Valley Hospital Auxiliary, The Auxiliary of Mission Hospital Laguna Beach, The Auxiliary of Mission Hospital Mission Viejo, Saint Joseph Hospital of Orange, Saint Joseph Hospital of Eureka and Redwood Memorial Hospital of Fortuna.
 
 The breach reportedly resulted in 31,802 potentially affected individuals.
 
 As noted above, the healthcare system responded by notifying local and federal authorities, notifying patients, and issuing one year free subscription to credit monitoring services.
 
 However, a group of potentially affected individuals came forward with a lawsuit against the health system, alleging wrongdoing on four accounts, the court documents state, including:
 
 violation of the CMIA [Confidentiality of Medical Information Act];
 negligence;
 money had and received; and
 violation of the California Unfair Competition Law (UCL), California Business and Professionals Code, Section 17200, et. Seq
 Healthcare data breaches often do result in these kinds of class action lawsuits.
 
  In the middle of last year, patients potentially affected by a healthcare data breach at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) filed a class action lawsuit, claiming that OPM had inadequate security provisions to protect PHI and that it consistently failed to meet Federal Information Security Management Act guidelines.
 
 UCLA Health is also facing a class action lawsuit following the large-scale healthcare data breach that potentially affected nearly 4.5 million patients.
 
 The class members, led by plaintiff Michael Allen, argue that UCLA Health was negligent in its efforts to notify the potentially affected individuals of the breach in a timely manner. UCLA Health reportedly discovered this breach on May 5, 2015, and the attack is believed to have occurred in September 2014.
 
 Additionally, the class members allege that UCLA Health did not take far enough measures to protect itself from the healthcare data breach.
 
  St. Joseph Health System has settled a class action lawsuit filed by two plaintiffs for the breach of 31,800 patient health records that took place in 2012. A settlement of $15 million will be split between patients and attorneys, with $7.5 million going to patients and $7.5 million covering attorneys’ fees and legal costs. All patients affected by the breach will receive a check for $242.
 
 A $3 million fund has also been set up to cover Identity theft losses that resulted from the exposure of patient health data. Each patient can potentially claim up to $25,000 if they can demonstrate they have suffered losses as a result of the data breach.
 
 The data breach in question lasted almost a year and affected patients from a number of hospitals and medical centers run by St. Joseph Health, including Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa, Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, Petaluma Valley Hospital; St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, the Auxiliary of Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo and Laguna Beach, Redwood Memorial Hospital of Fortuna, Saint Joseph Hospital of Orange and Eureka.
 
 Full medical records were not released and Social Security numbers were not exposed, although the names of patients, medical diagnoses, lab test results, medication allergies and personal health information such as body mass indexes were all potentially accessible over the Internet. The data were indexed by search engines such as Yahoo and Google. According to the plaintiffs, the data could easily be found in the search engines, although St. Joseph Health maintained that this would require very specific searched to have been conducted. The data exposure occurred as a result of misconfigured security settings.
 
 St. Joseph Health System released a statement apologizing for error and for causing undue concern to patients. It was pointed out that patient health data were subsequently secured and were de-indexed from the search engines.
 
 St. Joseph Health has since implemented a number of protections to improve safety and security, which include an enhanced data security infrastructure. The system upgrade to improve security cost St. Joseph Health more than $17 million and a further $4.5 million was spent on providing credit monitoring services to all breach victims.
 A settlement has been reached in a class action lawsuit alleging St. Joseph Health System failed to protect the confidential information of nearly 32,000 patients whose information was reportedly publicly accessible on the internet between February 2011 and February 2012.
 
 If your confidential medical information was publicly accessible on the internet by St. Joseph from Feb. 1, 2011 through Feb. 28, 2012, you may be entitled to a cash payment from this data breach class action settlement.
 
 The medical records that were available online reportedly included lists of patients’ names, dates of birth, height, weight, diagnoses, active medications, lab results, body mass index, blood pressure, medication allegories, and other confidential information. Financial information such as Social Security numbers were not included in the publicly accessible data.
 
 An investigation determined that the data exposure was not due to a criminal act, but was the result of misconfigured security settings.
 
 St. Joseph Health System denies the allegations but has agreed to settle the class action lawsuit to avoid the risk and expense of trial and possible appeals.
 
 
 
 Once final, the St. Joseph data breach settlement will provide cash payments to all eligible Class Members and offer reimbursement for identity theft losses and out-of-pocket expenses related to the medical data breach. St. Joseph previously offered all of the affected patients one year of identity theft protection.
 
 The data breach settlement will cost St. Joseph up to $28 million.
 
 Who’s Eligible
 Class Members of the data breach settlement include all patients of St. Joseph Health System whose confidential medical information was made publicly accessible on the internet by St. Joseph at any time between Feb. 1, 2011 and Feb. 28, 2012.
 
 Potential Award
 A cash payment of at least $241.35.
 
 Class Members may also file a claim to seek reimbursement of certain identity theft losses and out-of-pocket expenses related to the data breach.
 
 Proof of Purchase
 No proof is required to receive a cash payment of at least $241.35. Class Members will automatically receive this payment if the data breach settlement becomes final.
 
 Class Members who file a claim for reimbursement of identity theft losses and out-of-pocket expenses must provide documentation of their expenses.

2010,Montefiore Medical Center,NY,Theft,Laptop,"Two computer thefts at Montefiore Medical Center put sensitive data at risk (update 1)
 JULY 30, 2010DISSENT 4
 Montefiore Medical Center in New York has experienced two computer thefts in recent months. Although neither incident appears on HHS’s web site of reported breaches as of the time of this posting, a statement on Montefiore Medical Center‘s web site indicates that both thefts involved computers containing sensitive personal and medical information of patients and students. The stolen computers are described as “password-protected” but there is no mention of whether there was any encryption in use:
 
 Montefiore Medical Center has experienced two computer thefts.
 
 During the weekend of May 22, 2010, two desktop computers were stolen from Montefiore’s Finance Department. Montefiore discovered the theft on Monday, May 24, 2010. Some patient information was stored on the computers, including patient names and medical record numbers. The patients involved are covered by Medicaid and/or Medicare, including Medicaid or Medicare Managed Care Plans. In some cases, patients’ social security numbers, dates of birth, hospital admission dates and/or insurer information was also included. No diagnoses or other medical information was contained on the computers.
 
 After close of business on June 9, 2010, three desktop computers were stolen from Montefiore’s School Health Program Administrative Offices. The theft was discovered on June 10, 2010. Some information about students enrolled in Montefiore’s School Health Program was included on the computers.
 
 The information on the School Health computers included students’ names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, parent or guardian contact numbers and whether a student has a social security number. No actual social security numbers were on the stolen computers. For students diagnosed with asthma, the asthma diagnosis, vaccination information and number of visits to our school health clinic were also included. No other diagnoses or other medical information regarding the students was on the stolen computers.
 
 Each of the stolen desktops was password protected.
 
 Montefiore is cooperating with the police investigations. Neither Montefiore nor the police has any reason to believe that the thieves are interested in, or would use, any information stored on the computer. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, we are notifying the affected individuals and are providing advice concerning identity protection. Medicaid and Medicare patients, and parents, guardians or students can call Montefiore representatives at Identity Force, Toll free, at 800-295-0136, to find out if they are among the individuals whose information was stored on the stolen computers.
 
 Montefiore takes its patients’ privacy seriously, and regrets that these thefts have occurred. We are implementing additional measures to further maximize the security of patient information.
 
 A copy of the medical center’s notification to those affected by the June incident can be found here (pdf).
 
 Earlier this year, Montefiore also experienced the theft a laptop computer containing protected health information on 625 individuals. That theft, which occurred February 20, was reported to HHS on March 23.
 
 Update: According to a hospital spokesperson with whom I spoke today, the Finance Department theft affected 16,000 patients, while the School Health Program theft affected 23,000 students and their families. No arrest has been made in either case yet. The hospital declined to be specific about what steps they are taking to prevent future incidents of this kind, but note that they are taking steps.
 Eight alleged members of an identity theft ring, including a former assistant clerk at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, have been indicted on a variety of charges stemming from using stolen information on nearly 13,000 patients to make purchases at retailers.

 Ann Patterson, senior vice president and program director of the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance, says that the incident points to the need for ongoing vigilance by healthcare organizations to prevent and detect ID theft and other related crimes.
 
 Fraudulent Purchases
 Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. alleges in a statement that members of the ID theft ring made up to $50,000 in purchases at retailers in Manhattan by opening up store credit card accounts using patient information stolen by former hospital worker, Monique Walker, 32.
 
 Walker was an assistant clerk at Montefiore Medical Center, where her position gave her access to patients' names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and other personal information, Vance says.
 
 Between 2012 and 2013, Walker allegedly printed thousands of patients' records on a near daily basis and supplied them to a co-defendant, Fernando Salazar, 28, according to Vance's statement.
 
 Salazar is accused of acting as the ringleader of the operation. He allegedly purchased at least 250 items personal identifying information from Walker for as little as $3 per record, Vance says.
 
 The stolen information was then allegedly provided to other defendants to open credit card accounts that were used for purchasing gift cards and merchandize at retailers, including Barneys New York, Macy's, Victoria's Secret, Zales, Bergdorf Goodman and Lord & Taylor.
 
 Walker is charged with one count of felony grand larceny and one count of felony unlawful possession of personal identification information. The other defendants are charged with varying counts of grand larceny, identity theft and criminal possession of a forged instrument, among other charges.
 
 All of the defendants have been arrested and arraigned in criminal court, and have various dates pending for their next court appearances.
 
 ""Case after case, we've seen how theft by a single company insider, who is often working with identity thieves on the outside, can rapidly victimize a business and thousands of its customers,"" Vance says. ""Motivated by greed, profit and a complete disregard for their victims, identity thieves often feed stolen information to larger criminal operations, which then go on to defraud additional businesses and victims. In this case, a hospital employee privy to confidential patient records allegedly sold financial information for as little $3 per record.""
 
 Hospital Fires Worker
 A Montefiore spokeswoman tells Information Security Media Group that the medical center was informed by law enforcement on May 15 of Walker's alleged crimes dating back to 2012 and 2013. As a result, Walker, who worked for the hospital for about three years, was fired, the spokeswoman says. ""Montefiore is fully cooperating with law enforcement, including the Manhattan's District Attorney's office,"" a hospital statement says.
 
 Law enforcement discovered the connection to Montefiore patient information while investigators were working on the ID theft case, the Montefiore spokeswoman says.
 
 Of the 12,000-plus patient records that were compromised, it's uncertain how many individuals are victims of ID theft crimes, she says. But as a precaution, Montefiore is offering all impacted patients free identity recovery services, 12 months of free credit monitoring and a $1 million insurance policy to protect against identity theft-related costs.
 
 Montefiore has reported the breach to the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, the spokeswoman says. While that incident as of June 22 was not yet listed on HHS' ""wall of shame"" tally of health data breaches affecting 500 or more individuals, three other breaches at Montefiore Medical Center appear on the federal website.
 
 Those incidents, all reported in 2010, involved the theft of unencrypted computers. That includes the theft of a laptop in March 2010 which resulted in a breach impacting 625; and two July 2010 thefts of desktop computers that impacted 16,820 and 23,753 individuals.
 
 Breach Prevention Steps
 In a statement, Montefiore says that following the alleged crimes committed by Walker that were discovered in May, the hospital has expanded both its technology monitoring capabilities and employee training on safeguarding and accessing patient records to further bolster its privacy safeguards.
 
 ""The employee involved in this case received significant privacy and security training and despite that training, chose to violate our policies,"" the statement notes. ""In response to this incident, Montefiore is also adding additional technical safeguards to protect patient information from theft or similar criminal activity in the future.""
 
 A hospital spokeswoman says the hospital has rolled out ""sophisticated technology"" to monitor for improper access by employees to the hospital's electronic patient records
 
 The hospital also says it performs criminal background checks on all employees and ""has comprehensive policies and procedures, as well as a code of conduct, which prohibits employees from looking at patient records when there is not a work-related reason to do so.""
 
 Steps to Take
 Dan Berger, CEO of security consulting firm RedSpin, says it's not surprising the breach went undetected for so long because insider attacks are difficult to uncover. It's unclear if the Montefiore hospital clerk had ""good reason to access so many records"" as part of her job, he notes.
 
 Patterson of the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance notes: ""In addition to proper vetting of employees, the continued evaluation of employee education and awareness training programs and of your internal fraud detection programs is necessary. It's not something you do once and are done. Employees who are properly vetted upon initial hire may have changing circumstances that change their work integrity later on in their employ.""
 
 Additionally, security measures often need tweaking as circumstances within an organization change, she says.
 
 ""Fraud detection processes that worked when a specific type of workflow procedure was in place may need to be adjusted as that workflow process changes. An emphasis on continued evaluation of all components - people, process, technologies - for fraud detection is good practice.""
 
 Workforce training is important not only for preventing breaches, including those involving ID crimes, but also to help detect those incidents, she says. ""Each employee must understand their role in protecting PHI. Equally important is regular and continued evaluation of the training programs to make sure that employees are adhering to the policies put in place, and that the 'red flags' detection systems are keeping pace with changing technologies and workplace practices.""",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2.0,625.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 - Thursday, June 25th, 2015 Print | Email
  
 The Manhattan District Attorney has handed down eight indictments, including one for an employee of Bronx, N.Y.-based Montefiore Medical Center, for stealing and using patients' personal identifying information to make thousands of dollars in purchases.
 
 Although the information of 12,517 patients was stolen between January and June 2013, Montefiore did not learn of the incident until May 15 when it was informed by law enforcement officials, according to a Crain's New York Business report.

2017,Morehead Memorial Hospital,NC,HACK,Email,"The data breach at Morehead Memorial Hospital in Eden potentially affected personal information belonging to about 66,000 people, the hospital said.
 
 Morehead Memorial learned on July 21 that a phishing attack affected two employee email accounts, possibly exposing patient and employee information. The hospital announced the data breach on Sept. 15.
 
 “It is something that every organization, not just hospitals, is dealing with” said Dana Weston, chief executive officer and president of Morehead Memorial, of the cyberattack.
 
 “We were very fortunate here,” she said. “Our great staff identified the threat early on.”
 
 The information that may have been exposed includes health insurance payment summaries, treatment overviews, health plan information and social security numbers.
 
 Morehead Memorial, which filed for bankruptcy in July, has been managed by Novant Health since 2014.
 
 “Although Novant Health manages Morehead Memorial Hospital, the IT systems are separate,” said spokeswoman Ashton Miller. “Novant Health was not impacted by the recent data breach.”
 
 Cone Health said it “is unaware of any breach of our patient’s information due to cyberattacks,” but that such attacks are a concern for all hospitals.
 
 Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center echoed this sentiment.
 
 “These are every day threats to any large system network,” said Wake Forest Baptist in a statement. “We remain vigilant against such attacks and do not disclose our security measures or system processes for that reason.”
 Morehead Memorial Hospital in Eden, NC has announced two employees have fallen victim to a phishing attack that resulted in an unauthorized individual gaining access to their email accounts. Those accounts contained the protected health information of patients and sensitive information on employees.
 
 Upon discovery of the breach, access to the email accounts was blocked and the hospital performed a network-wide password reset. Leading computer forensics experts were hired to assist with the investigation and determine the extent of the breach. The investigation confirmed that access to the accounts was possible and sensitive patient and employee information could have been accessed.
 
 While no reports have been received to suggest any information in the accounts has been misused, the possibility of data access and data theft could not be ruled out. The types of information exposed includes names, health insurance payment summaries, health insurance information, treatment overviews, and a limited number of Social Security numbers.
 
 Phishing attacks such as this are common. Emails are sent to healthcare employees that appear to be legitimate communications. The emails typically include hyperlinks that, when clicked, require login details to email accounts to be entered. Entering in that information provides the credentials to the attackers, who then use the information to remotely login to email accounts.
 
 Preventing phishing attacks requires a combination of spam filtering technology to prevent phishing emails from reaching inboxes and education to teach employees about the risk from phishing and how to identify phishing attacks.
 
 In response to the breach, Morehead Memorial Hospital is providing staff members with additional training to help them identify fraudulent communications. An internal webpage has also been created to communicate further information about phishing and email attacks to keep staff better informed.
 
 The incident has been reported to the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Office for Civil Rights. Patients were notified of the breach by mail on Friday last week and all have been offered identity theft monitoring services for 12 months without charge.
 
 Morehead Memorial Hospital has said the breach impacted approximately 66,000 patients.",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0.0,66000.0,6600000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2016,Morton Medical Center,WA,HACK,Other,"In March 2016, the covered entity (CE), Morton Medical Center, reported that a virus encrypted many of its merge documents and held them for ransom, preventing the CE from printing any documents that required merging data. An internal investigation revealed that the ransomware had been introduced into its systems through an “add-on” through the Internet. After paying the ransom, the hacker(s) released the CE's entire electronic protected health information (ePHI). The hack affected the ePHI of approximately 3,000 individuals; however, there were no indications that ePHI was actually uploaded or accessed. If the hackers accessed the ePHI, it would have contained names, addresses, demographic information and, possibly, some diagnostic information. Following the hack, the CE conducted an enterprise-wide analysis of the various risks to its ePHI and developed a risk management plan. The CE then overhauled its entire information technology system, focusing on strengthening its physical, administrative, and technical safeguards.

The computer was not encrypted and in some cases, social security numbers were included in the patients’ files. No details were provided as to the details of the theft.
 
 Within the past week, 100,000 patients of Peninsula Orthopaedic Associates in Maryland and patients of Lakeland Radiologists in Mississippi also learned that their sensitive information had been stolen. Not one incident report indicated that the patient data had been encrypted at the time of theft.
 An laptop containing the personal information of patents of Moses Cone Hospital in Greenboro, N.C. was recently stolen from a supply chain management vendor that the hospital works with.
 
 How many victims? 14,380.
 
 What type of personal information? Social Security numbers.
 
 What happened? The laptop was issued an employee of VHA, a supply chain management vendor for the hospital. In March, the laptop was stolen from the employee’s car. It was not encrypted but was password protected.
 
 Details: The breach affected cardiology and orthopedic patients treated at Moses Cone Health System’s Hospitals between February 2004 and February 2009.
 
 What was the response? Affected individuals have been offered free credit monitoring.

 On Oct. 26, an employee of the Mount Carmel Bariatric Program sent a “save the date” email informing recipients of the Mount Carmel-sponsored 2017 bariatric social event at the Grange Insurance Audubon Center, the release said. The employee intended to send the email to individual recipients but inadvertently sent one email to all individuals who might be interested in the event. The email displayed the email addresses of all recipients. The email did not contain any telephone number, Social Security number, date of birth, home address or financial information, the release said. The error was identified immediately, and the employee attempted to retract/recall the email, the release said.
 
 Former patients were included on the email, and their email addresses were disclosed to the other recipients. Affected individuals were notified that they received the email and were asked to delete the email from their inbox and refrain from forwarding or sharing it, the release said.

 POTENTIAL PHI BREACH REPORTED BY OH HEALTH SYSTEM
 Mount Carmel Health System recently announced on its website that 836 former bariatric patients may have had their information involved in a possible PHI breach.
 
 A Mount Carmel Bariatric Program employee sent a “save the date” email on October 26, 2017. The employee reportedly wanted to send the “save the date” to individual recipients of the Mount Carmel-sponsored 2017 bariatric social event at Grange Insurance Audubon Center. However, the email displayed all recipients’ email addresses.
 
 The organization maintained that telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, and financial information were not involved.
 
 The employee tried to immediately retract/recall the email. Email recipients were asked to delete the message and not forward or share the email.
 
 “All employees are required to undergo training appropriate to perform the services that they provide,” Mount Carmel explained. “Nevertheless, Mount Carmel is further analyzing procedures and will take corrective measures as necessary to ensure that instances like this are prevented in the future.

2014,Mount Sinai Beth Israel,NY,Theft,Laptop,"Central Dermatology Center is facing a possible health data breach after finding malware was uploaded into one of its computer servers.
 November 10, 2014 - A North Carolina dermatology center is working through the aftermath of a potential health data breach after it was discovered that malware had been uploaded through a server.
 
 
 On Sept. 25, 2014, the Central Dermatology Center had one of its central servers compromised by malware, according to a facility statement from Nov. 7. Forensic IT experts were contacted immediately to identify the malware, remove it, and determine what information might have been accessed, Central explained.
 
 The information that was potentially exposed in the health data breach includes a variety of patient health information, although Central said that the organization’s electronic medical records (EMR) were not on the compromised server. However, patients’ names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing and diagnostic codes, insurance company, insurance co-payment information, healthcare providers, employer information, sex, treatment dates, account balances, email addresses, and race, were all potentially accessed.
 
 “Taking aggressive action early and confronting this issue is consistent with the practice’s core value of behaving in an ethical and transparent fashion,” Greg Catt, Practice Administrator at Central Dermatology Center & Carolina Medi-Spa said in a statement. “Central hired a prominent forensics security expert firm and an information technology firm that investigated this incident, reviewed all systems, and Central has improved our security wherever necessary to help protect our community. On behalf of the people of Central Dermatology Center, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.”

 While Central said that the malware was discovered on Sept. 25 of this year, the malware was believed to have compromised the password protected server “on or about August 9, 2012.” This happened in spite of technical safeguards being in place, Central said, including software on the server that is designed to prevent such malware.
 
 The statement did not say how many patients were potentially affected, just that those individuals are being contacted and will be offered free credit monitoring and identity theft protection.
 
 Laptop stolen from Mount Sinai Beth Israel
 
 Mount Sinai Beth Israel announced that a password-protected, personal laptop computer was stolen from a staff room on Aug. 8. The laptop itself was password-protected, but the contents were not encrypted, according to a facility statement.
 
 “Stored on the laptop were emails from an OB / GYN physician’s Mount Sinai Beth Israel email account that contained information on approximately 10,790 patients, including patient names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, dates of service, procedure codes and description of procedures, as well as clinical information about the care the patients received,” the statement said.
 
 However, patient Social Security numbers, insurance information, addresses and telephone numbers were not stored on the laptop.
 
 The hospital reported the health data breach to the New York City Police Department and also to the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
 
 Mount Sinai said that it has since taken additional steps to enhance security. For example, the hospital said it has installed additional door locks and security cameras.

2012,Mount Sinai Hospital,FL,INSD,Other,"Former Mount Sinai Medical Center employee convicted in patient ID theft for tax refund fraud scheme
 OCTOBER 25, 2013DISSENT
 Oliver Gayle of Miami has been convicted in an tax refund scheme involving the theft of patient information from Mount Sinai Medical Center. Gayle, who was employed as a temp, had a previous felony conviction on RICO/racketeering charges prior to his employment at the medical center. The South Florida Business Journal asked the medical center how he obtained employment with that criminal background. The medical center sent them a statement:
 
 “The temp agency provided a false background check on Mr. Gayle. The document did not include his prior conviction for racketeering and the date was deleted, which masked the fact that the background check was one year old. We no longer do business with this agency and have revised our background check process so this will not happen again.”
 
 According to testimony and evidence presented at trial, on February 27, 2013, the Aventura Police Department stopped a vehicle driven by Gayle after being alerted by a U.S. bank of an individual who attempted to cash a fraudulent check. Gayle presented a Jamaican passport as his form of identification. During an inventory search of the vehicle driven by Gayle, officers uncovered a black bag containing over 100 printouts from Mt. Sinai Medical Center Account Inquiry Processor with multiple names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and addresses of patients on each printout. Additionally, photocopies of checks written to Mt. Sinai Medical Center from various individuals with a photocopy of the corresponding billing statement from Mt. Sinai were found in the bag.
 
 According to court documents and trial testimony, during a consensual search of Gayle’s residence, law enforcement found multiple printouts from Mt. Sinai Medical Center that appeared similar to the ones found in his black bag. Law enforcement also found copies of U.S. Treasury checks; a document labeled “HIT LIST” with a list of names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth; several tax returns in the names of other individuals; multiple Tax Act and Turbo Tax pre-paid debit cards issued in the names of other individuals; a Jamaican passport in Gayle’s name containing a counterfeit U.S. visa; and, an identification badge for Mt. Sinai Medical Center with Gayle’s name and photo.
 
 Sentencing is scheduled for January 9, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Donald L. Graham.
 
 This is not the first insider breach at Mount Sinai Medical Center reported on this blog. In May 2012, the same U.S. Attorney’s Office announced the arrest of Keiondra Sheri Williams, who was employed as a specimen control clerk. As in the Gayle case, the data theft was discovered in the course of a search following a vehicle stop. And in both cases, printouts with patient information were found:
 
 The affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint alleges that on March 24, 2011, North Miami Beach Police Department stopped a vehicle for reckless driving. During a consensual search of the vehicle, law enforcement found a brief case containing what appeared to be personal identifying information from patients at Mount Sinai Hospital. The briefcase also contained seven (7) credit cards and approximately eleven (11) computer screen print outs from Mount Sinai Hospital. The words “Duplicate SS” or “IRS Accepted” were handwritten on several pages of these hospital printouts.
 
 According to the complaint, subsequent investigation revealed that the eleven (11) computer screen print outs were printed by defendant Williams, who was employed at Mount Sinai Hospital as a specimen control clerk. The investigation revealed that within five days, Williams accessed and printed approximately 339 patient records that contained names, social security numbers, patient identification, and dates of birth. Williams had no lawful reason nor did he have authorized access to view or print these patient records. On May 30, 2012, members of the IRS Identity Theft Task Force arrested Williams in Miami Gardens.
 
 So what steps did the medical center take after the Williams case to prevent a recurrence? And how is it that they seemingly neither prevented nor detected Gayle’s activities?

Mesa hospital missing data files for more than 2,200 patients

The Arizona Republic

Mountain Vista Medical Center is changing its security procedures as the search for missing records for 2,284 endoscopy patients continues.

The hospital discovered the compact memory data cards from endoscopy procedures from January of 2008 to October of this year were missing on Oct. 13 of this year, beginning a thorough investigation to find the missing records that contain personal patient information.

""Information security and patient privacy are top priorities,"" hospital CEO Tony Marinello said. ""We deeply regret the inconvenience this has caused and will do everything we can to help those who may have been affected.""

The information on the data cards includes patients' full name, date of birth, age, sex, hospital medical record number and physician's last name. The cards also contain information and images from the endoscopy procedures.

However, Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, addresses and telephone numbers were not listed on the data cards.

""Hospital leadership has no evidence that information involved in the incident has been accessed or improperly used,"" said Audrianne Schneider, Mountain Vista Medical Center spokeswoman. ""However, every precaution is being taken to reduce the potential risk of misuse of the information.""

All of the patients were contacted about the missing data cards. They were warned to protect their credit by monitoring credit reports or enrolling for one year with a credit reporting agency for alerts on any major changes from the daily credit activity. Mountain Vista Medical Center created the toll-free line, 1-877-736-4495, for affected patients to call with any questions or concerns about enrollment.

The medical center also changed its security setup for the compact memory data card storage and removed the memory card option from the endoscopy machines.

Mount Sinai Medical Center in Florida reported that 628 patients were notified of a breach that seemingly occurred over a period of months. Curiously, the report on HHS’s breach tool did not include any mention of the business associate, even though it was employee of a vendor who reportedly stole patient information. A statement on the medical center’s web site explains:
At Mount Sinai Medical Center, we take our commitment to patient privacy very seriously, and we work diligently to ensure the security of our patients’ confidential information. Regrettably, this notification concerns an incident related to that information.

On February 28, 2013, we learned from local law enforcement that an employee of a contracted vendor of the Medical Center may have accessed patient information inappropriately from October 2012 to February 2013. Upon learning this information, we conducted an investigation and began fully cooperating with law enforcement authorities. The suspect has been arrested.

Our investigation confirms that the information involved includes patient names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and addresses. A second group of information includes patient names, addresses, bank account numbers, and routing numbers. While a patient’s information may have been exposed, it does not mean that it was misused. The incident did not affect any patients’ medical records, medical treatment or Mount Sinai billing accounts.

Also, if you have concerns about this situation and have not received a letter from us by March 29, 2013, please call the help line with your questions.

2017,MultiCare Health System,WA,HACK,Email,"Email Account Compromised: 1,200 MultiCare Patients’ ePHI Exposed
Posted By HIPAA Journal on Jan 27, 2017

The Tacoma, WA-based MultiCare Health System has announced that the email account of one of its employees has been compromised by a hacker following a successful phishing attack.
 
 The five-hospital health system issued a statement yesterday about the email security breach confirming patients’ protected health information had been compromised. It is unclear when access to the email account was first gained, although the email security breach was discovered by MultiCare Health on November 27, 2016.
 
 An investigation into the breach was immediately launched and rapid action was taken to secure the health system’s email accounts, including resetting passwords on all email accounts. However, the investigation revealed that only one email account had been compromised.

An analysis of the email account revealed that emails contained the ePHI of 1,200 former and current patients. Data potentially accessed by the attacker included patients’ names, addresses, dates of birth, genders, dates of service, account balances, and diagnosis and treatment information. MultiCare has confirmed that the compromised email account contained no Social Security numbers or financial information.

Patients are in the process of being notified of the security breach by mail and have been advised to check their Explanation of Benefits statements and to report any irregularities. To date, MultiCare has not received any reports of misuse of patients’ information.

Phishing attacks on healthcare organizations are to be expected. It is therefore essential for healthcare organizations to make employees aware of the risk of phishing and how to identify potential phishing attacks. Phishing simulation exercises are highly effective at reinforcing training and can greatly improve detection of phishing emails. Healthcare organizations should also set up a system of reporting potential phishing emails. Fast detection can help to prevent other employees from falling for the scams.

To counter the threat and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, MultiCare Health is reinforcing the education and training of its employees and will be providing staff members with additional training on phishing email detection. A review of security practices and procedures and ePHI safeguards has also been scheduled.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1.0,1200.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

We believe the binder was lost on or about December 5, 2011. The information that was lost involved Hospital inpatients and outpatients receiving flu tests between January 1, 2011 and December 5, 2011. To date, we are unaware that any personal information has been misused by any unauthorized person.

The information contained in the binder included the patient’s full name, internal hospital department and internal account number, gender, medical record number, date of birth and age, date of test, and flu testing results noted as positive or negative. No other health information was contained in the log. No other financial information such as social security number or outstanding balances was contained in the binder.

Once the binder was identified as missing, the Hospital promptly began an investigation and a search of the Hospital’s Laboratory Department and surrounding areas. The binder was not located and remains missing.

To protect against further potential breaches, paper laboratory log books have been discontinued and only electronic logs will be used. In addition, the entire Laboratory Department received additional training on safeguarding patient information.

Patients who have any questions or would like further information should contact Amy Box, Privacy Officer and Director of Health Information Management, at 918-684-3578, or via e-mail at Amy.Box@CapellaHealth.com, or at MRMC, 300 Rockefeller Drive, Muskogee, OK 74401.

A statement on the clinic’s web site, which I found through a Google search and not via a link from their home page, says:

NEA Baptist Clinic’s former public website was compromised by an electronic attack on July 12, 2011. Individuals affected by the incident are those people who previously registered with the website as part of using one of the website’s special functions. NEA Baptist Clinic immediately took down the website and then engaged a private, information security firm to assist in analyzing the details of the attack. Based on the analysis performed, the information compromised includes email addresses or usernames along with passwords for the NEA Baptist Clinic website. In some cases, additional information such as names, addresses, and dates of birth, also may have been compromised. No Social Security numbers were involved. No medical records were involved.

Baptist is encouraging all persons who previously registered with the website to change their passwords if they used the same password for any other account. Although we believe that the risk of personal information being used improperly is relatively low, we are aware that the hacker was able to crack some of the more basic passwords used on the website. If you regularly use the same password for all accounts you create, you need to change your passwords at this time. Of particuar concern are the passwords for any financial accounts or other accounts that are linked to a bank account or credit card number, for example, a Paypal, eBay, or Amazon.com account.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1.0,3116.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2010,North Carolina Baptist Hospital,NC,Theft,Paper/Films,"Patient Information Stolen from Employee’s Car
March 4, 2010
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – A bag containing a paper document with the names and Social Security numbers of 554 patients of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center was stolen from an employee’s locked car on Feb. 15.

All of the affected patients have been notified by mail, and Wake Forest Baptist has arranged for professional monitoring of financial and credit-related activity that could indicate possible misuse of the information. The activity will be monitored for one year at no cost to the patients affected. The service also includes addressing any problems that arise from the misuse of the personal information. Wake Forest Baptist will also maintain a telephone hotline for these patients.

“We deeply regret this incident and the inconvenience that this situation presents for these patients,” said J.T. Moser, Wake Forest Baptist’s chief privacy officer. “Our intention now is to prevent any harm to these patients as a result of the theft, and to take steps to reduce the likelihood that this kind of loss will happen again.”

The document was in a designer tote bag. Investigators believe that the bag was the target of the theft and that the document was inadvertently taken. The list did not contain details of the patients’ medical conditions.

The theft occurred in the parking deck of an off-campus outpatient clinic. The employee had taken the document home for work purposes, and upon returning to the office the employee left the bag in the car. The break-in was discovered later in the day. Once the employee verified that the bag was missing, Medical Center privacy officials were immediately notified and the theft was reported to the Winston-Salem Police Department.

Moser said that the Medical Center has policies about the handling of patients’ protected health information. However, he said, “We are currently reviewing our existing policies for any updates or improvements that might be necessary, and we intend to increase employee awareness and our enforcement of these policies.”

Although the employee in this incident reported the theft as soon as it was discovered, Moser said that current policy mandates that employees keep protected information secure at all times, and unfortunately that was not done in this case. As a result, he said, the Medical Center is taking “appropriate action.”",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1.0,554.0,55400.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

BY ALICE SPERI FEBRUARY 11, 2011 1:41 PMFebruary 11, 2011 1:41 pm
Update, 3:15 p.m. | 

Some 1.7 million patients, staff members, contractors and vendors had their medical and other personal records from city hospitals in the Bronx stolen, the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation said Friday. The affected hospitals were Jacobi Medical Center, North Central Bronx Hospital and two affiliated clinics. The “overwhelming majority” of those who had their data stolen were patients, the agency said.

The theft of electronic files, which contained both patient health records and medical information about workers — with names, addresses and Social Security numbers — occurred on Dec. 23, when an information-management company’s van was left unlocked and unattended in Manhattan, the hospitals corporation said.

On Wednesday, the agency started mailing notification letters to the victims, in 17 languages, announcing an information hot line and customer care centers at both hospitals, and offering free credit monitoring and fraud resolution services for one year. Those interested in the offer have 120 days to register. The notification text is also available online.

The hospitals corporation said it had taken “decisive steps to protect the individuals who are potentially affected,” even though there is no evidence the information, contained on computer backup tapes that were being delivered to “a secure storage location,” has been accessed or misused. It also said that the data is stored in a program “that would make it difficult for someone without technical knowledge to access the private information.”

The hospitals corporation has filed suit to hold the vendor, GRM Information Management Services, responsible for covering all damages related to the loss of the data.",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1.0,1700000.0,170000000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

North Country Health Services' online bill-paying function was apparently hacked into on April 18, compromising the security of 349 customers' credit card and debit card accounts.
Written By: Bethany Wesley | Apr 29th 2010 - 12am.
North Country Health Services' online bill-paying function was apparently hacked into on April 18, compromising the security of 349 customers' credit card and debit card accounts.

NCHS is sending letters to all those who could be affected by the breach, said Joy Johnson, NCHS vice president for marketing and business development.

The incident is only related to the health system's online bill pay, she noted. Those who paid by credit card in person or use an ATM at the hospital are not affected.

""If you don't get a letter, you don't need to worry,"" she noted.

Johnson and Troy Ament, NCHS technical services director, said NCHS shut down its online bill-paying service ""immediately"" after the problem was identified.

Investigator Jaeger Bellows with the Bemidji Police Department said the Police Department and Beltrami County Sheriff's Office are working to determine any impact that the security breach will have on the community.

Bellows encouraged anyone to report any unauthorized transactions on their credit cards and/or debit cards to law enforcement.

""At this point we can't say that every case of credit card fraud will be related to the NCRH breach,"" Bellows said in an e-mail. ""We'll investigate each case on its own merit.""

Those interested in reporting suspicious activity to contact either the Police Department or Sheriff's Office, depending on the location of the residence. The Police Department will give possible victims a credit card fraud checklist.

Ament said NCHS' online bill-paying system - which has been in place for ""years"" - is consistent with industry standards.

""This is a huge, industry-wide problem,"" he said.

Ament noted that 336,000 complaints were received last year due to security breaches similar to the one experienced at NCHS.

In fact, President Barack Obama last year hired Howard Schmidt, a former Microsoft security executive and a one-time cybersecurity adviser to President George W. Bush, as cybersecurity coordinator. Schmidt, the so-called ""cyber czar,"" is supposed to help protect government and private-sector computer systems.

Ament noted that the number of online security breaches have doubled in the last 12 months.

Johnson and Ament said the source of the hacking was tracked back to Hanoi, Vietnam.",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,11.0,349.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2013,"North Country Hospital and Health Center, Inc",VT,Theft,Laptop,"Discarded Or Stolen? Hospital Patient Record Dispute Lingers In Newport
By CHARLOTTE ALBRIGHT • OCT 16, 2013

A standoff continues between North Country Hospital in Newport and a former I.T. employee who says he found a discarded computer with patient records still on it, after it had been retired by the hospital. 

The saga highlights the importance of scrubbing private data from used computers.

The Newport hospital is assuring patients that no further breach of privacy will occur. But the man who has the computer says he won’t give it back until the hospital stops calling him a thief.

The I.T. worker is named Christian Cornelius. He  also goes by the name Christian George.

He says the laptop computer was brought to him at home last April by a neighbor who also worked for North Country Hospital. He says she wanted him to re-configure it as a gift to her husband.

Cornelius says he wasn’t getting along with the worker back then, so he shelved it until he was fired by the hospital in July. Then, he says, he started sorting through electronics in his home and discovered something surprising about that laptop.

“Turned it on and didn’t expect to see a Windows logo pop up, but it did. Discovered that there was a hard drive in it and that there was a perfectly working image of North Country Hospital business on the laptop,” Cornelius said.

He says patient records were accessible. Cornelius says a volunteer is supposed to destroy hard drives in retired laptops before they are given to employees for personal use.

“So when he comes in he’s got a stack of laptops and what he’s supposed to do is remove the hard drives from the machine and put them in a shredding bin inside my data center,” he said.

But he believes that protocol is not always followed. Cornelius says his job at the hospital was to operate the data center—not to de-commission hard drives. So he insists it’s not his fault that the computer left the hospital with patient records still on it. He says he immediately notified the hospital and asked what to do with the laptop, but did not get a prompt reply.

The hospital tells a very different story. Nancy Goss is in charge of Community Relations.

“I don’t know how it got to his home but part of his job when he worked here, part of everyone’s job in the IT department, is to clean off the hard drives of recycled computers, of computers—laptops or desktops that are given to other users,” Goss said.

The hospital demanded the return of the laptop. Cornelius now refuses to comply because he says police have served him with a citation for larceny.

“At this point they are indicating that it’s a stolen laptop; it is in fact a discarded laptop that was given to me by a third party.”

So the dispute seems to have reached a stand-off. Meanwhile, the hospital has published a notice in local newspapers, apologizing to patients whose records may be on the computer and assuring them that passwords have been changed so than no unauthorized user can access personal data.

2011,North Memorial Health Care,MN,Theft,Laptop,"March 17, 2016 - North Memorial Health Care of Minnesota will pay approximately $1.5 million in HIPAA settlement fines after it failed to identify its business associates, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reports.
 
 healthcare-security-hipaa-violation
 Healthcare business associates are organizations that work on behalf of, or for, a covered entity. Healthcare organizations that list business associates need to make sure these deals are explicitly signed in order to make sure that the business associate will adequately safeguard any PHI or other health information they obtain.
 
 In the case of North Memorial, the hospital failed to identify Accretive Health, Inc. as a business associate. The parameters of the relationship between the two organizations caused Accretive to gain access to North Memorial’s databases, which contained PHI.
 
 This caused some trouble when an Accretive employee had a laptop stolen, disclosing PHI for thousands of North Memorial clients. The hospital first notified HHS of the incident on September 27, 2011, and told the agency that the breach had been discovered on July 25, 2011. Originally, the hospital told HHS that the laptop contained PHI for 2,800 patients, but that number was later revised to add an additional 6,697 patients.
 
 Medical Device Security Discussed in Federal Rule Proposal
 Advocate Medical Group endures massive data breach
 Healthcare BYOD security: Using new management technologies
 Although North Memorial reported to HHS that Accretive was one of its business associates, the department learned upon further investigation that for a period of time there was no signed agreement between the two entities.
 
 Signed business associate agreements are important because they demonstrate a promise that the business associate will take appropriate healthcare data security measures.
 
 According to HHS’s findings, North Memorial started sending Accretive PHI on March 21, 2011, but that the two had not entered into a written agreement until October 14, 2011. This amounts to over a six month period during which PHI was transferred between the two entities without a proper business associate agreement.
 
 As a result, North Memorial has been charged with paying HHS $1,550,000 in HIPAA settlements.
 
 Additionally, the healthcare organization must adhere to a corrective action plan. This action plan calls for North Memorial to develop business associate policies and procedures, modify their existing risk analysis procedures, development internal risk management plans, and undergo training.
 
 This case is an example of how important it is that covered entities clearly elucidate their business associate agreements. By entering into a written contract that guarantees a business associate’s HIPAA compliance, a healthcare organization ensures that PHI will be adequately safeguarded.
 
 Likewise, these agreements ensure that in the unfortunate event of a healthcare data breach, business associates will be held responsible for federal regulatory actions.
 
 Business associate agreements need to fully address the acceptable uses and disclosures for PHI on the part of the business associate. This makes clear that business associates are only allowed to disclose PHI to specifically identified entities or individuals, and holds them liable to HIPAA regulations of they do not adhere to these rules.
 
 Business associate agreements also address the fact that these provisions apply to all subcontractors with whom the business associate may be working.
 
 These agreements also should include the expectations for PHI safeguards that the covered entity has for the business associate, and should specify that at the end of the relationship, the business associate must return all PHI back to the covered entity.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,9497.0,0.0,1.0,1550000.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2019,North Ottawa Community Health System,MI,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"GRAND HAVEN, MI -- Private medical records that may have included Social Security numbers of more than 4,000 patients at a Grand Haven hospital were improperly accessed by a hospital employee over more than three years.
 
 Between May 2016 and Oct. 2019, a hospital employee accessed the records of 4,013 patients at the North Ottawa Community Health System, 1309 Sheldon Road, according to a letter sent to affected patients.
 
 Another employee brought forth concerns on Oct. 15, and the hospital launched an internal investigation on Oct. 17, according to a statement sent to MLive by Jen VanSkiver, the health system’s chief communications officer.
 
 The investigation was conducted by hospital management, its Office of Compliance, and the IT department, VanSkiver told MLive in an interview. It concluded on Nov. 25, ultimately finding that thousands of electronic health records had been accessed, seemingly at random.
 
 Financial records, which are stored on a different system, were not affected.
 
 The employee, whose access to digital records was suspended during the investigation, has been terminated. He or she appears to have been motivated by simple “curiosity,” said VanSkiver, adding that there was no evidence suggesting that patient information had been shared or used improperly.
 
 The data accessed also appeared to be “random,” VanSkiver said, not following any discernible pattern.
 
 According to HIPAA, the federal law that monitors medical privacy rights, any breach of more than 500 patient records must be reported to the Department of Health and Human Services. VanSkiver said that the hospital reported the incident to DHS’ Office for Civil Rights on Dec. 16. Any next steps, including possible charges against the employee, are now up to the federal government.
 
 “The case is in their hands,” VanSkiver said.
 
 VanSkiver declined to give any details about the employee in question, including their role or department, citing confidentiality in personnel matters.
 
 The North Ottawa Community Health System comprises a hospital, hospice services, long-term care, urgent care, and emergency medical services. Only hospital patients were affected by the breach, VanSkiver said.
 
 Moreover, different data was accessed for each patient. The letter that each affected patient received lists what type of data was accessed, which may include identifying information such as patient’s name, date of birth, Social Security number, Medicare/Medicaid number, and insurance information.
 
 Those whose Social Security numbers were accessed will receive free credit and identity theft monitoring for one year.
 
 When asked about the gap of time between the investigation’s conclusion and the date that patients were first notified, VanSkiver said that the hospital had to coordinate its response for all patients, using outside legal counsel. She added that all patients were alerted within a federally-mandated 60-day window.
 
 In a statement, NOCHS apologized for the breach, and said that it had tightened employee access to patient records and would increase training for new and existing staff on privacy laws.
 
 Affected patients or anyone with questions can call the hospital’s toll-free line, 844-967-1231, Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1262.0,4013.0,401300.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2012,North Shore University Hospital,NY,Other,Other,"NEW YORK
 Eyewitness News has learned that patients at /*North Shore University Hospital*/ have been notified that their private health records, including social security numbers and insurance information, have been stolen.
 
 New York State Police are saying this is an ongoing and widespread probe.
 
 Eyewitness News just learned that there were actually two security breaches at North Shore; one last year where the hospital says 50 patients were notified, and there was another breakdown in the system this year, beginning in January, where patients records were compromised again.
 
 The hospital says that theft involved about a hundred people who've also now been warned.
 
 It's hard to imagine that your privacy inside a hospital could be as vulnerable as your health, but Eyewitness News obtained a letter that North Shore University Hospital on Long Island has sent to patients, notifying them that confidential information on the computer network was stolen in an attempt to open up credit cards in the person's name.
 
 What was included in those records was: date of birth, address, phone number, medical record number, social security number, insurance information, and potentially the medical history.
 
 ""This is a major security breach of information system and is a warning to other medical institutions to look at their systems,"" said Bill Daly, Senior V.P. Control Risk.
 
 Attorney Bonita Zelman represents one critically ill patient who received North Shore's letter which also tells patients they'll get one year of free credit monitoring services.
 
 ""My client has already been financially impacted because he was notified by a Target store in Massachusetts that somebody attempted to open up a charge account in his name,"" Zelman said.
 
 Zelman says it wasn't only Target, but also the credit department from Macy's that contacted her client about identity theft.
 
 The patient had no idea there was a connection until he got the hospital letter late last month.
 Twelve people recently filed a lawsuit against New York's North Shore University Hospital in response to the theft of hospital face sheets containing their personal information (including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birthdates, medical histories and other data).
 
 ""Unlike many of these types of cases, some [of] the plaintiffs have already had their identities stolen and will be looking for compensatory and punitive damages beyond future identity and credit monitoring,"" writes HealthITSecurity's Patrick Ouellette. ""The suit argues that the hospital was negligent, misrepresentative, breached its fiduciary duty, breached its contract and violated HIPAA.""
 
 ""One victim received a letter saying a fraudulent tax return was filed with her Social Security number on it, the suit said,"" CBS New York reports. ""Others saw hundreds or even thousands of dollars charged to fraudulent credit cards and cell phone accounts opened up in their names. Last year, two suspects -- Clincy M. Robinson and Dennis Messias -- were arrested and charged separately with identity theft in connection with the hospital face sheet thefts, the lawsuit said.""
 
 ""[Robinson] was convicted in December of identity theft and sentenced to 6 months time served and 5 years' probation after he was found with printouts containing North Shore-LIJ patient information,"" writes Newsday's Ridgely Ochs.
 ""How outrageous is that,"" Zelman said.
 
 Eyewitness News has learned that a Brooklyn man, Clincy Robinson, Sr. who lists himself as a health care professional on his my space page, has now been indicted in Nassau County for identity theft, and possessing computer data from North Shore containing information on over 900 people.
 
 He's a licensed nurse but it's not clear of his connection to the hospital.
 
 Robinson and an alleged accomplice are also accused of grand larceny connected to purchases at Target and Macy's.
 
 The criminal complaint says the crimes took place during a three-month span a year ago, but the hospital says corporate security learned of the incident on March 19th of this year.
 
 ""The question is when did they know, what did they do about it immediately to protect their patients from further harm?"" Zelman said.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,90.0,950.0,95000.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

2016,Northern Navajo Medical Center,NM,DISC,Other,"The medical records of approximately 7,500 patients of an Indian Health Service medical center have been recovered from storage units in Waterflow in New Mexico, at least 5 months after they were stolen by a former employee.
 
 Back in October, the records of 470 patients of the Northern Navajo Medical Center in Shiprock were found in a public storage facility by a community member. The matter was reported to the Navajo Area Indian Health Service on October 5, 2015, and staff were sent to recover the documents.
 
 According to the IHS breach notice, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General Investigator investigated the breach and discovered that files had been taken by a former employee. Some of the employee’s personal items were also located in the storage facility.
 
 The investigation revealed that the data breach was much more extensive than initially thought. A further 7,000 documents were also recovered from storage facilities and have now been returned to the medical center. Now that the files have been recovered, patients are being notified of the breach of their protected health Information (PHI). The delay in issuing breach notification letters to patients was at the request of law enforcement while the investigation into the theft was being conducted.
 
 The PHI contained in the files was highly sensitive and included the names of patients, their health insurance details, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, and medical diagnoses. Patients are now being provided with a year of credit monitoring and identity protection services via ID Experts, and will be protected with a $1,000,000 identity theft insurance policy.
 
 Some months have passed since the files were taken, but Indian Health Service has not received any reports of data being used inappropriately.
 
 To prevent similar data breaches from occurring in the future, Indian Health Service is conducting additional face to face training with staff members on document management responsibilities and further training is also being provided on laws covering the maintenance of government documents. Policies and procedures have also been updated to reduce the risk of further PHI breaches.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,150.0,7421.0,1742100.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2014,Northfield Hospital & Clinics,MN,Improper Disposal,Paper/Films,"Northfield Hospital & Clinics has recently issued a HIPAA breach notification to approximately 1,800 of its patients after their Protected Health Information (PHI) was potentially exposed to unauthorized individuals over an eight day period in October this year. The security breach only affected a small percentage of Northfield patients and no medical information is believed to have been accessed, although the matter is being treated with the utmost seriousness.
 
 The security breach occurred when a number of documents were disposed of in commercial dumpsters by mistake, rather than being destroyed as required by HIPAA data security and privacy rules. When Protected Health Information is no longer required it must be destroyed or rendered unusable, with the rules applying to paper records and all electronic data.
 
 Paper records containing PHI and other confidential information must be shredded, incinerated or rendered unreadable to ensure that patient health information is not accidentally disclosed. In the case of Northfield Hospital & Clinics, the records included some credit card numbers; however the paper records contained a considerable amount of personally identifiable information together with Social Security numbers and dates of birth; exactly the information that many criminals hope to acquire for purposes of committing medical fraud.
 
 Once the error was noticed, the hospital took rapid action to mitigate the damage and changed procedures to prevent similar mistakes from occurring in the future. Paper recycling bins are now no longer kept next to desks to reduce the risk of accidental disposal of confidential waste in commercial recycling bins and a number of other policies and procedures are being introduced to improve data security. The staff will receive training on the correct methods for disposing confidential waste, while the cleaning staff will be supervised until further notice. Secure confidential waste containers have also been installed in central areas and the disposal of their contents will be strictly controlled.
 
 Steve Underdahl president of Northfield Hospital & Clinics issued an apology to patients stating that Northfield clinics are “learning from it [the incident] and are emerging with more secure protocols”. The probability of disclosure of PHI is very low, although “we always want to error [err] on the side of caution and do what we can to mitigate the impact of the incident,” he said.
 
 Part of the mitigation plan involves setting up a dedicated 800 number for patients to call with any questions relating to the HIPAA breach and the 1,778 affected individuals are being offered free credit monitoring services for a period of 12 months.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,1778.0,177800.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 Statement Regarding Hospice Burglary and Patient Health Information Breach
 
 On the evening of June 11, 2012, Northwestern Memorial Hospital’s Home Hospice offices at 676 N. St. Clair Street in Chicago were burglarized and six laptop and tablet computer devices were stolen. Once discovered, the matter was immediately reported to the Chicago Police Department and an internal investigation begun to determine what, if any health information may have been compromised. On June 15th, it was determined that at the time of the theft, the devices were undergoing a software upgrade and standard laptop security controls suspended; therefore leaving personal health information for Northwestern Memorial’s Home Hospice and former Home Health patients accessible.
 
 Accessible personal information on the devices could include: the patient’s personal demographics, including full name, address, date of birth and social security number; the patient’s medical treatment profile related to home hospice or former home health services, including diagnosis, acuity of symptoms, medications, treatment notes and advanced directives; and payor information, including the patient’s health insurance group and policy numbers.
 
 Letters have been sent to impacted patients or their families notifying them of this breach, and mailings will continue to reach as many as possible through mail. We do not believe the personal information stored on the devices was the target of this theft, but we will continue to work closely with the Chicago Police Department to identify the thieves and locate the devices.
 
 We are assisting those affected by providing a credit bureau monitoring service to catch irregularities that may signal identity theft. We recommend that individuals review their credit reports, explanation of benefits statements, and credit card, bank and other financial statements for any unauthorized activity. If individuals believe they have been the victim of identity theft or have reason to believe their personal information has been misused, they should immediately contact the Federal Trade Commission and/or the attorney general’s office in Illinois.
 
 We regret and apologize for this incident and are taking decisive measures to mitigate the impact and prevent future breaches. For example, we are reviewing the procedures that resulted in the process failure and limiting the number of patient records stored on laptop and tablet computers.
 
 We appreciate the trust that our patients and their families place in Northwestern Memorial and are committed to resolving this matter and assisting patients who have been affected. Anyone with questions or anyone who believes they may be affected and has not received a notification letter can call (855) 755-8480 and use the reference number 6963071312. Patients can also visit www.nmh.org and go to the “Notices” link at the bottom right corner for more information.
 
 For how long had the security controls been suspended at the time of the theft? Was this really just a stroke of bad luck/timing or had the data been left unprotected for longer than was really necessary? Hopefully, HHS will inquire.

2012,Northwestern Memorial Hospital,IL,INSD,Other,"Northwestern Memorial Hospital employee has been charged with identity theft after she allegedly used the personal information of hospital patients to pay her bills.
 
 Shatina Golden, 35, of Matteson is charged with aggravated identity theft and identity theft. She has worked at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for the last four years, according to the state’s attorney’s office.
 
 Matteson police began investigating Golden after village officials spotted “suspicious credit card activity” involving payments for her home water bill, the state’s attorney office.
 
 Police said they identified the actual owners of credit cards Golden was using to pay her bills. And they learned from credit companies that all of the cards had been used at a laboratory at Northwestern Memorial.
 
 During a search of Golden’s home, Matteson police found credit card numbers, birth dates and Social Security numbers from more than 50 patients, according to the state’s attorney’s office.
 
 Breaches of patient records have exposed private information of more than 250,000 people in Illinois since September 2009, including health records collected by several hospitals, a radiologist practice, a medical lab, a hospice and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, according to a government database.
 
 Businesses that handle billing or other kinds of services for health providers have accounted for six of the 19 largest breaches in the state since the fall of 2009.
 
 Golden appeared in Markham court where her bail was set at $10,000. She is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on June 4. If convicted, Golden faces up to seven years in prison.",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,50.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2011,Nyack Hospital,NY,PORT,Other,"NYACK — Former and current Nyack Hospital employees, as well as their spouses and children, are at risk of identity theft because a computer hard drive containing personal information was stolen from the hospital, officials said.
 Sensitive data, including names, addresses, dates of birth and Social Security numbers, were stored on a hard drive in the hospital's Human Resources Department, President David Freed told current and former workers in a letter obtained by The Journal News.
 ""The hospital sincerely regrets that your information was included on the hard drive that was stolen,"" Freed wrote. The hospital is offering free credit monitoring for a year to employees whose data were stolen.
 It was unclear how many people were affected by the security breach at Nyack Hospital, which has about 1,400 workers and is one of Rockland's largest employers. Also unclear is how far back the records of former employees begin, but indications were that some date back 12 years or more.
 Hospital officials declined to comment Tuesday, except to release a statement saying that the hospital ""is committed to the safety and security of all active and former employee information and takes every measure to safeguard personal data.""
 It does not appear that patient information was kept on the missing hard drive.
 The theft is related to the June 23 flash flood that dumped more than 4 inches of rain in Nyack in less than a half-hour and left parts of the hospital under water.
 According to Freed's letter, the Human Resources Department had to be relocated because of the flood. When workers returned to the original office July 6, after repairs were made, the theft was discovered.
 Orangetown police are investigating, Lt. James Brown said.
 Hospital officials said the computer was kept in a secure area with video surveillance.
 Even the best-designed security can fail during a disaster like a flood, said Robert Richardson, director of the Computer Security Institute, a professional organization.
 In the case of a flood that required extensive repairs, it is easy to imagine that a door was propped open to allow better air flow even as numerous contractors and other outside workers might have been in an area where sensitive data were stored, he said.
 Many organizations use extra security within a computer system, such as encryption, which can limit the damage if data are lost or stolen, Richardson said.
 But some businesses don't use encryption because it can slow down ease of access to information that is needed by a large number of people.
 ""If the hospital didn't encrypt the data, they are not out of step with their peers,"" Richardson said.
 That the hard drive was removed, but the computer apparently was not, likely means the person who stole the drive was looking for personal information, experts said.
 ""The possibilities are endless,"" said Lt. John Gould, head of the computer crime task force for the Rockland Sheriff's Office . ""It really is an identity theft nightmare.""
 Computer security lapses are common, said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy with the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization devoted to consumer privacy. The organization has recorded more than 500 million such breaches since 2005.
 ""These breaches happen almost every day of the year,"" Stephens said.
 There are ways people can protect themselves even if their personal information is stolen, he said. He suggests people take advantage of free credit score monitoring if it is being offered.
 Consumers also can contact the nation's three credit bureaus to request a ""credit freeze,"" which will prevent anyone from accessing your credit file unless the credit bureau is authorized to release your report.
 Tips on how to do that are on the group's website at www.privacyrights.org under Identity Theft & Data Breaches, Fact Sheets, 17b: How to Deal with a Security Breach.Potential victims have no way to know how long they will be at risk if the thief intends to use the information, experts said.
 ""Everyone loses in a situation like this,"" Richardson said. ""It's not like the company has any interest in exposing their employees to crime, but they need to be really attentive because it sounds like whoever has this data has the intention of using it criminally.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,13.0,1400.0,140000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (“HHC”), which operates the North and Central
 Brooklyn Health Network’s East New York Diagnostic and Treatment Center (“East NY”), values the importance
 of protecting the confidentiality of our patients’ medical records. Therefore, we regret to inform you of an incident
 that may have potentially resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of your protected health information (“PHI”),
 including your name, address, medical record number, treatment information, and social security number.
 Although we have no actual evidence that your PHI was disclosed inappropriately to unauthorized viewers,
 we are required by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) to inform you of this
 incident in writing, as well as the actions we are taking and the actions you may take to protect yourself from
 potential harm that may result from this incident.
 Description of Incident
 In the course of performing an HHC privacy and information security audit, we learned, on August 11,
 2014, that a number of unsecured storage boxes containing medical and dental records were inappropriately stored
 inside the employee parking garage at East NY. These boxes contained the medical and/or dental records from
 several closed HHC clinics, including: (1) the Howard Houses Child Health Center; (2) the Brevoort Houses Child
 Health Clinic; (3) the Fifth Avenue Child Health Clinic and (4) dental records from the closed dental clinic at the
 Brownsville Child Health Clinic. These medical and dental records pertained to patients who, like you, had
 previously been treated at these now-closed clinics.
 While there is no indication that these records, including yours, were ever accessed or improperly viewed,
 their storage in this location was certainly improper and created the risk for a potential misuse of personal
 information. Therefore, in an abundance of caution, we are notifying you of this incident.
 What We Have Done In Response to the Breach
 East NY has promptly taken a number of steps in response to this incident. First, upon discovery of the
 incident, arrangements were immediately made to secure the boxes, and on August 15, 2014, all boxes were moved
 to a remote and secure location.
 Second, we have arranged for the availability of the services of a third-party vendor, AllClear ID, Inc., to
 provide you with credit monitoring for a period of one year at no cost to you. The services offered are as follows:
 
 · AllClear SECURE: You are automatically eligible to use this service – there is no action required on your
 part. If a problem arises, simply call 1-866-979-2599 and a dedicated investigator will do the work to
 recover financial losses, restore your credit and make sure your identity is returned to its proper condition.
 Dear John Q. Sample,
 Re: Notification Regarding Your
  Personal Health Information
 · AllClear PRO: This service offers additional layers of protection including credit monitoring and a $1
 million identity theft insurance policy. For a child under 18 years old, AllClear ID ChildScan identifies
 acts of credit, criminal, medical or employment fraud against children by searching thousands of public
 databases for use of your child’s information. To use the PRO service, you will need to provide your
 personal information to AllClear ID. You may sign up online at enroll.allclearid.com or by phone by
 calling 1-866-979-2599 using the following redemption code: 999999999.
 Please note: Additional steps may be required by you in order to activate your phone alerts.
 Lastly, East NY is also in the process of examining its internal privacy practices and will implement, where
 appropriate, policies and procedures to prevent an incident of this nature from reoccurring in the future.
 What You Can Do
 In addition to contacting AllClear ID to arrange for free credit monitoring services, below are further steps
 you may wish to take to protect yourself from potential harm arising from this incident:
 1) Order a free credit report. Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, you are entitled to receive a free copy of
 your credit report from each of the three national consumer reporting companies (Equifax, Experian and
 TransUnion) once every twelve months. After you receive your credit report you should review it to see if it
 contains activity that you do not recognize, such as accounts that you have not opened, or debts that you did not
 incur. If you discover information in your credit report that you believe to be fraudulent, contact the credit reporting
 company to remove this information. You may obtain your free credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com
 or by telephone at 1-877-322-8228.
 Although you may request credit reports from all three credit reporting companies at the same time, another strategy
 would be to order from one company immediately and from the other two over a period of weeks or months to see if
 any unrecognized activity appears over time.
 2) Place a credit alert on your consumer credit files. Call the toll-free number of any one of the three major credit
 reporting companies listed below to place a free 90-day fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent an
 identity thief from opening accounts in your name. As soon as the credit reporting company confirms your fraud
 alert, the other two credit bureaus will automatically be notified to place alerts on your credit report.
 · Equifax: 1-800-525-6285/ www.equifax.com/ P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241
 · Experian: 1-888-EXPERIAN (397-3742) / www.experian.com / P.O. Box 9532, Allen TX 75013.
 · TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289 / www.transunion.com / Fraud Victim Assistance Division, P.O. Box
 6790, Fullerton, CA 92834-6790.
 3) Monitor your account activities. Read your financial account statements and health insurance statements of
 services promptly upon receiving them to confirm that they are accurate. Also, make sure that you are receiving
 your regular bills to ensure that your accounts have not been switched. Be concerned if you receive credit cards that
 you did not apply for, or you receive communications from creditors regarding goods or services you did not
 purchase.
 4) Request access to your medical record and, if appropriate, file a request to amend your record. You may wish
 to review your medical record to determine whether your information has been compromised. Depending on your
 review, you may file a request to amend your record to correct any information that you believe does not
 appropriately apply to your medical record. To review your medical record, please file a HIPAA Request to Access
 form (HHC 2426) with Health Information Management (“HIM”) at East NY. After your review, if you want to
 make an amendment, file a HIPAA Request for Amendment form (HHC 2415) with HIM.
 5) Additional measures you may take. You will also find additional useful information about these and other
 measures you may take to protect yourself on the following websites:

 We at HHC take our role of safeguarding your personal information and using it in an appropriate manner
 very seriously. As a result of this incident, additional facility audits are planned to ensure that medical records are
 properly secured and stored. Further, HHC has planned additional training for its staff. Please be advised that the
 person responsible for improperly storing the medical records at the East NY site no longer works for East NY or at
 any other HHC facility. HHC apologizes for the concern this incident may have caused and assures you that we are
 doing everything we can to prevent an incident of this nature from reoccurring.

 The tasks included logging patient names into a log book, cleaning up storage department areas, and transporting specimens within the Coney Island facility.
 
 While logging patient information into the facility’s log book and transporting specimens, the volunteer was given access to patient PHI including names, medical record numbers, and dates of birth.
 
 According to the OCR data breach reporting tool, the PHI of 3,494 patients was potentially affected.
 
 While the volunteer should not have had access to patient PHI without being properly processed, the hospital states no personal information has been shared or misused.
 
 In light of the incident, NYC Health + Hospital at Coney Island notified potentially impacted patients of the incident and reminded management of the necessity to process all volunteers through the Human Resources Department before administering tasks.
 
 Additionally, the hospital has set up a toll-free call center for any patients concerned about the safety of their information.

Financial Corporation had a breach affecting 9,475 patients’ protected health information. The breach occurred on or about September 27. A notice posted to Ochsner’s web site on December 8 states:
 
 On October 4, 2010, Ochsner Health System was notified by some of our patients that letters sent out by the HELP Financial Corporation (765 Wing Street, Plymouth, MI 48170) on behalf of Ochsner contained incorrect patient information. These patients indicated the name, medical record number, account number, and account balance on the letter did not match the records for the person to whom the letter was mailed. Ochsner has a contract with HELP to assist patients with payment arrangements for their outstanding hospital and/or clinic account balances.
 
 Ochsner’s investigation revealed that the mistake was the result of a programming error at HELP Financial Corporation. HELP has identified how the problem occurred and has assured Ochsner that the problem has been corrected. HELP has also adjusted their procedures to ensure that another programming error does not occur.

2012,Ochsner Medical Center,LA,PORT,Other,"LA: Ochsner reports hard drive, patient records missing
 FEBRUARY 21, 2012DISSENT 1
 Ochsner is reporting yet another breach involving patient data:
 
 Staff at Ochsner Medical Center say an external hard drive containing patients’ personal and medical information is missing from the West Bank campus.
 
 The hard drive is designed to work with a bone density machine at the campus, and it was discovered missing Sunday.
 
 “After an exhaustive physical search, the external drive could not be located,” reads a news release from Ochsner. “As part of our commitment to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of our patients’ information, we immediately initiated an investigation. Ochsner’s investigation revealed that the external hard drive is no longer in Ochsner’s possession.
 
 “Unfortunately, we cannot precisely say what data was contained on the external hard drive,” the statement continues. “The data may include patient names, addresses, date of birth, medical record number, medications, and pertinent medical history as it pertains to a bone density scan between November 2005 and January 2012.”

 This is their third breach notice since December 2010. The first involved a contractor and the second involved a dishonest janitor.
 
 Ochsner’s Feb. 20th media statement on the incident:
 
 On January 19, 2012, Ochsner Medical Center – West Bank Campus staff discovered that an external hard drive for the bone density machine was missing. After an exhaustive physical search, the external drive could not be located.
 
 As part of our commitment to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of our patients’ information, we immediately initiated an investigation. Ochsner’s investigation revealed that the external hard drive is no longer in Ochsner’s possession.
 
 Unfortunately, we cannot precisely say what data was contained on the external hard drive. The data may include patient names, addresses, date of birth, medical record number, medications, and pertinent medical history as it pertains to a bone density scan between November 2005 and January 2012. A bone density scan is a radiology exam that measures bone mass which is used as a screening tool for osteoporosis.
 
 The above information and the results of the bone density scans are not lost. They are still a part of each patient’s medical record. The external hard drive for the bone density machine was used only to back up the data.
 
 Because the data was stored in a proprietary format, Ochsner does not believe that it is possible to access the information simply by connecting the hard drive to a computer and opening the files. To access the information in a readable format, one would have to use various software applications. At this time we feel that there is minimal risk to patients’ personal information.
 
 At Ochsner, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of our patients is our top priority. We deeply regret this occurrence and any inconvenience it may have caused. The protection of our patients’ private information is important to Ochsner Health System, and we are committed to maintaining and improving the security of our patients’ personal information.
 
 Any Ochsner patient affected by this incident will receive a detailed notification letter from Ochsner Medical Center – West Bank Campus. However, Ochsner urges any patients with questions or concerns regarding this notification or the letter they receive to please contact the Ochsner Medical Center – West Bank Campus Patient Relations Department at 1-855-808-4104.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0,2088.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2017,St. Charles Health System,OR,DISC,Other,"The former St. Charles Health System employee who inappropriately viewed the medical records of 2,459 patients is facing criminal charges that carry a maximum penalty of two years in jail.
 
 Prineville resident Dawnielle Vaca, 35, viewed the records while working as a certified nursing assistant. The Deschutes County District Attorney filed two counts of computer crimes, both Class A misdemeanors.
 
 The records, accessed between Oct. 8, 2014, and Jan. 16, included patients’ diagnoses, their physicians’ names, medical histories, medications and treatment information. They also included names, addresses, birthdates and health insurance information.
 
 District Attorney John Hummel said he can’t think of anything more personal than someone’s medical record.
 
 “Looking at someone’s medical records is not like looking at someone’s housing records or employment records,” he said. “We’re sharing details with our providers about our mental health history, maybe our relationship issues. You might be having struggles with loved ones. We talk about our medication use.”
 
 During his investigation, Hummel said he received unsolicited phone calls from some of the affected patients, who told him they felt violated. St. Charles offered a year of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services to everyone affected.
 
 Vaca declined to comment when reached by phone Tuesday. She holds an active certified nursing assistant license in Oregon and the state Board of Nursing website lists no disciplinary action on her license. Ruby Jason, the board’s executive director, said her office investigates any time criminal charges are filed against its licensees and that she was aware of the charges against Vaca.
 
 Hummel said his investigation did not find any evidence that patients were harmed financially. Vaca was not attempting to commit fraud, financial crimes or damage St. Charles’ computer system, he said. If she had been, Hummel said the charges would have been felonies.
 
 Rather, Hummel said Vaca looked at the records out of curiosity. Because she has no prior criminal history, Hummel said he won’t pursue the maximum penalty the charges carry. Vaca’s first hearing is scheduled for July 27.
 
 Hummel declined to release any documents from his and the Bend Police Department’s joint investigation into the case. The investigation is currently on hold, but could proceed if Vaca decides to pursue a trial rather than pleading guilty, Hummel said.
 
 St. Charles learned of the breach and launched its investigation Jan. 16. A spokeswoman declined to say when Vaca was fired, but Hummel said she had already been fired when he began his investigation in March.
 
 Hummel criticized St. Charles’ decision not to notify the police of the breach. While no law directs the health system to do so, he said in his mind, “it’s common sense.” Hummel said he learned about the breach through media reports and notified the Bend Police Department himself.

 “I felt the impact to their patients, my constituents, was such that this should have been reported to law enforcement,” he said.
 
 St. Charles spokeswoman Lisa Goodman said the health system followed federal and state laws by notifying the affected patients, the state attorney general and the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Vaca worked at St. Charles Bend and Madras, she said.
 
 Ultimately, Hummel said he’s concerned a breach like this could prevent people from sharing sensitive information with their medical providers, which could affect their health. He said it’s especially difficult to share mental health struggles due to the fear of stigma.
 
 “To think that people could get to the point where they’re brave enough to come forward under the pretense of privacy and then know that somebody read your records, that’s hard,” he said. “So when I become aware of a breach like this, I’ll do what I have to do to make sure that offenders are held accountable.”",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,831.0,2459.0,245900.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2011,OhioHealth Corporation dba Grant Medical Center,OH,Theft,Desktop Computer,"POTENTIAL SECURITY BREACH AT GRANT
 
 COLUMBUS, Ohio – On November 5, 2010, Grant Medical Center discovered that out-of- service computers were stolen from an inventory storage facility. Grant Medical Center immediately investigated and determined that the thefts were accomplished by one employee. Grant immediately strengthened the inventory controls and storage processes for out of service computers and terminated the employee involved. The employee attempted to clean information off the hard drives but used a technique that may not always be wholly effective. Although data remaining on the hard drives could include some unsecured personal health information for patients treated at Grant Medical Center between 2008 and November 5, 2010, it is inaccessible to anyone except skilled computer technicians with specialized software and equipment. To date, we are unaware that any personal information has been recovered or misused by any unauthorized person.
 
 This announcement is a substitute notice under the HIPAA notice of breach rules. Individuals who believe that they may have been affected may call 1-888-845-0818 for assistance. This hotline number will remain in effect for at least 90 days. 
 
 OhioHealth officials announced yesterday that they will provide one year of credit protection to anyone who was a patient at Grant Medical Center from Jan. 1, 2008, through Nov. 5, 2010.
 
 Mark Hopkins, a spokesman for OhioHealth, which owns Grant, said an employee stole computers from an inventory storage facility that contained patient health information.
 
 The employee, who has since been fired, “tried to clean the hard drives and resell them,” Hopkins said.
 
 The hospital system reported the theft to Columbus police on Nov. 16.
 
 Lt. Mike Woods of the burglary bureau said police recovered a laptop, four desktop computers and five monitors from a local computer store. The stolen items were returned to OhioHealth.
 
 Hopkins said it’s unlikely any patient information was accessed because it was encrypted and password-protected.

2018,Oklahoma State University,OK,HACK,Network Server,"A health data breach reported to federal regulators as a ""hacking/IT incident"" impacting nearly 280,000 Medicaid patients in Oklahoma has experts wondering exactly what happened.
 The Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences reported the incident Jan. 5 to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as impacting a network server and affecting 279,865 individuals. A notification letter OSUCHS is sending to affected individuals notes that the incident was discovered nearly two months earlier.
 
 ""On Nov. 7, 2017, we learned an unauthorized third party had gained access to folders on the OSUCHS computer network,"" the notification letter says. ""These folders stored Medicaid patient billing information. On Nov. 8th, we took immediate action to remove the folders from the computer network and terminated the third-party access. We also launched a thorough investigation, including hiring an independent data security firm. The firm assisted us in determining whether the folders had been compromised.""
 
 The OSUCHS incident is not only the largest breach reported that's been posted on the HHS HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool website - commonly called the ""wall of shame"" - so far this year but also ranks as the fourth largest breach occurring in 2017.
 
 The HHS Office for Civil Rights, which enforces HIPAA, posts to the ""wall of shame"" reports of breaches impacting 500 or more individuals as the agency confirms details of the incident. Other breaches occurring in 2017 could also potentially be added to the tally in the coming months.
 
 The breach follows the trend in 2017 - as well as in 2016 - of large hacking incidents dominating top breaches posted on the wall of shame.
 
 Hacking was the cause of nine of the 10 top breaches in 2017 and about 70 percent of the total number of individuals affected by all health data breaches during the year (see 2017 Health Data Breach Tally: An Analysis).
 
 Notification Letter
 In its notification letter, OSUCHS says its investigation could not rule out that the third party accessed patient information. ""The information in the folders may have included patients' names, Medicaid numbers, healthcare provider names, dates of service and limited treatment information,"" the letter states. ""It is important to note these folders did not contain medical records. A single Social Security number was contained on the server.""
 
 OSUCHS's notification letter says the organization has ""no conclusive indication of any inappropriate use of patient information"" and did not mention whether it planned to offer free credit and identity theft monitoring to affected individuals.
 
 OSUCHS did not immediately respond to an Information Security Media Group request for additional information about the breach.
 
 Scant Details
 While the OCUCHS notification letter also doesn't provide details about whether the organization has any clues about the identity of the ""unauthorized third-party"" who accessed the data - whether it was indeed an unknown hacker or a perhaps an unauthorized insider - such as an employee of contractor - the incident spotlights the array of risks and threats to protected health information.
 
 ""'Unauthorized third party' is a very vague identification,"" says Kate Borten, president of the privacy and security consulting firm The Marblehead Group. ""This could be a total stranger on the internet, or this could be a known contractor or business associate who had been granted access to the OSUCHS network or a specific system, but was not authorized to access this Medicaid folder,"" she says.
 
 ""In some ways, the latter is far more serious since it suggests that internal access controls were not properly implemented. And insider threats are more dangerous since insiders may know where assets are stored and what weaknesses are in the systems.
 
 David Finn, executive vice president of strategic innovation at security consulting firm CynergisTek, points out: ""At this point any speculation about how an unauthorized third party gained access to these folders would be just that - speculation.
 
 ""What it does point to ... is that getting access to health information is still too easy, be it a malicious outsider or a well-intended insider. It also indicates that organizations that maintain PHI still don't understand their data - where it is, how it got there, where it came from, who is using it, what they are doing with it and where they are sending it.""
 
 The OSUCHS incident is the second major breach reported so far in 2018 involving Medicaid data. On Jan. 5, Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, which regulates healthcare facilities and is responsible for administering Medicaid in that state, also reported a hacking incident to HHS. The Agency for Health Care Administration says in a statement that the incident, which affected 30,000, involved a phishing attack in November.
 
 ""The Medicaid data is PHI and access should have been tightly restricted,"" Borten says. While OSUCHS has not indicated whether the Medicaid data was encrypted, encryption would have thwarted the breach in some circumstances.""
 
 Important Lessons
 While OSUCHS also has not divulged whether its incident - like the one in Florida - also involved phishing or some other type of cyberattack, experts say the breach provides important lessons.
 
 Most organizations need to make security improvements in a number of areas, says Rebecca Herold, president of Simbus, a privacy and cloud security services firm, and CEO of The Privacy Professor consultancy.
 
 Oof. Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences is notifying 279,865 Medicaid patients of a hacking incident. Here is the notice from OSU’s web site:
 
 Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences (OSUCHS) takes the privacy and security of our patients’ information very seriously. Regrettably, this notice is regarding an incident in which some Medicaid patient information may have been compromised.
 
 On November 7, 2017, we learned an unauthorized third party had gained access to folders on the OSUCHS computer network. These folders stored Medicaid patient billing information. On November 8th, we took immediate action to remove the folders from the computer network and terminated the third party access. We also launched a thorough investigation, including hiring an independent data security firm. The firm assisted us in determining whether the folders had been compromised.
 
 The investigation could not rule out whether the third party explicitly accessed patient information. The information in the folders may have included patients’ names, Medicaid numbers, healthcare provider names, dates of service, and limited treatment information. It is important to note these folders did not contain medical records. A single social security number was contained on the server.
 
 We have no conclusive indication of any inappropriate use of patient information. However, out an abundance of caution, we began mailing letters to affected patients on January 5, 2018. We also established a dedicated call center to answer any questions our patients may have. If you believe your information was affected and do not receive a letter by February 15, 2018, or if you have questions regarding this incident, please call 1-844-551-1727, Monday through Friday, 8 am to 8 pm Central Time. For patients affected by this incident, please be alert to any healthcare services you did not receive from any of your providers. If you learn of any services you did not receive, please contact your provider and Medicaid immediately.
 
 At OSU Center for Health Sciences, we care deeply about our patients. Patient confidentiality is a critical part of our commitment to care and we work diligently to protect patient information. We apologize for any concern or inconvenience this incident may cause our patients. Since this incident, we have implemented additional security measures to enhance the protection of our patient information.
 
 Although the number of patients affected was not included in their notice, the incident was reported to HHS and appears on their web site.
 That includes keeping operating systems and networks regularly patched and updated; conducting vulnerability and penetration testing; performing regular risk analyses; providing ongoing workforce training; implementing a BA information security oversight management program; and ensuring secure disposal practices.
 
 ""There are far too many issues that get overlooked. I've seen breaches occur as a result of many of these situations,"" she says.
 
 Finn says the OSUCHS breach highlights once again ""that data is not only the currency of healthcare in today's world; it is also the most important asset. This isn't about the investigation, the fines, breach notification or even buying credit monitoring for the victims. This has damaged healthcare at this institution. This is about patient care, the quality of that care and trust in the system.""
 
 A second lesson from the incident, he contends, is: ""In this age of hyper-connectivity in healthcare, your security is only as good as the worst security at those places, agencies, organizations you share data with. The more connectivity you have - from simple file sharing to remote access to your resources - the more vulnerabilities you have. You must take steps to ensure everyone you connect with is secure themselves or your sharing is designed to protect yourself.""",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 Allina Health Privacy Incident Possibly Exposes Patient Info
 Recent potential data breaches include the improper disposal of patient documents, unauthorized employee access to patient EHRs, and stolen devices containing PHI.
 
 March 09, 2017 - Minnesota-based Allina Health recently announced that paper documents were emptied into the trash before the documents could be securely shredded.
 
 The documents were from a recycling bin in the physician’s private office, and were to be shredded at the Minneapolis Heart Institute at Abbott Northwestern Hospital.
 
 On January 20, 2017, Allina Health became aware of the incident and launched an investigation. Allina Health explained that the documents may have contained patient information including names, medical record numbers, addresses, and insurance information.
 
 According to the OCR data breach reporting tool, 776 patients were potentially impacted by the incident.
 
 Because some patients use their Social Security numbers as identification numbers on insurance documents, there is a chance these patients Social Security numbers were exposed, Allina Health stated.

 The healthcare system added that there is no evidence any patient information was viewed or misused.
 
 Allina Health is notifying potentially affected patients of the incident explaining what occurred and offering one year of free credit monitoring and identity protection services.
 
 “Allina Health has simplified its systemwide process to require all paper and documents be placed into secured or locked shredding bins, whether or not the paper contains patient information,” the statement explained. “All paper is shredded and then recycled. The enhanced process also removes all desk-side recycling bins to prevent paper from being placed into recycling without being shredded first.”

 On February 6, 2017, Sharp Healthcare discovered a computer and external storage device were missing from a locked cabinet in a restricted patient care area at the Sharp Memorial Outpatient Pavilion in San Diego.
 
 According to Times of San Diego report, the PHI of over 750 outpatients at the facility may have been accessed as a result of the incident. The devices are believed to have been stolen.
 
 “The devices were used to process and store patient-specific wellness screening information for outpatients undergoing blood pressure and/or cardiac health studies,” Sharp Healthcare said in a statement. “Each study record may have included patient name, date of birth, age, current medications, family history and a summary of the studies performed.”
 
 Sharp mailed letters notifying affected patients of the incident, and added that it is conducting a security practices review.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2012,Oregon Health and Science University Hospital (OHSU),OR,PORT,Other,"Oregon Health & Science University Hospital officials have posted a notice on their web site. While most of the notice concerns patient information, it appears that almost 200 employees had their Social Security Numbers on the stolen USB drive.
 
 OHSU has set up a toll free number to respond to patient questions. Information stored on the stolen computer drive was used to track the care of premature infants. Unless your past interactions with OHSU involved the care of a premature or newborn infant cared for in the neonatal ICU, your information was not on the stolen computer drive. If you still have questions, call this toll free number to speak with a representative: 1-855-650-6955.
 
 Oregon Health & Science University Hospital officials are sending letters to the families of 702 pediatric patients after a USB drive containing some of their patient information was stolen. In total, data for more than 14,000 patients was stored on the drive, along with information for about 200 OHSU employees.
 
 The incident does not impact all OHSU patients, but affects a limited number of premature pediatric patients who were screened for vision issues. In the vast majority of cases, the data is very limited in scope. None of the patient data is the kind of information typically used for identity theft. Nearly all the patient data was password-protected, and all of the data can only be opened by software not commonly found on personal computers. Nevertheless, OHSU is contacting patients to make them aware of the situation.
 
 The thumb drive carrying the data was stolen during the burglary of an OHSU employee’s home July 4 or 5. The employee inadvertently took the USB drive home in a briefcase at the end of the workday. During the home burglary, the briefcase along with several other items was stolen.
 
 Prior to the theft, the drive was used to back up data from one OHSU computer system to another and is normally locked in a secure location on campus after use. Since the theft occurred, OHSU has conducted an extensive investigation into exactly what was taken and the steps needed to access the password-protected data and open the files in a readable format.
 
 Following is a list of the data contained on the stolen drive:
 
 Pediatric patient information (name, date of birth, phone number, address, OHSU medical record number, and a one- to four-word description of the patient’s medical condition, or family medical history in some cases) for approximately 14,300 patients. The data is gathered to track the results of vision screenings for newborns born prematurely. Nearly all of this data is password-protected, and all of it is in an uncommon file format. A subset of the data for these patients was slightly more sensitive because it contains data that is considered more personal. These patients (702 in total) are receiving letters from OHSU this week.
 A database of OHSU staff information, including names, Social Security numbers, addresses, employment-related vaccination information for 195 OHSU employees.
 “Based on the home burglary investigation, the motive of the thieves appeared to be stealing items, such as jewelry, that could quickly be resold for money,” explained Ron Marcum, M.D., interim chief corporate integrity officer in the OHSU Integrity Office.
 
 “It’s likely that the USB drive was never the target. In fact, other computer equipment in the home was left untouched. Nevertheless, based on our investigation, we are contacting families because we think it’s the right thing to do. We are also reporting the theft to the federal office that manages health information privacy and a police report was filed.”
 
 OHSU has several measures in place to protect patient information, including encryption software for computers, password protections and secure programs for managing patient information and tracking usage. The university also provides extensive training to all employees who have access to patient data. In addition, the university has enacted several layers of policy to help protect this information.
 
 In regard to this case, while the stolen USB drive was never intended to leave campus, OHSU has been working to develop methods for ensuring USB drives are encrypted. OHSU plans to step up these efforts in light of this incident.
 
 OHSU has also created an FAQ on the breach. It says, in part:
 The stolen drive contained records for more than 14,000 people, yet you are only contacting 702 patients. Why not contact the entire group?
 None of the patient data included Social Security numbers or other data typically used for identity theft. Also, nearly all the data was password-protected. However, in 702 cases, records referenced health conditions that are a bit more personal or might be an embarrassment for a patient if disclosed. We are contacting that subgroup – not because they are in any significant heightened risk – because we want them to be aware of the nature of the data as it pertains to them.
 
 This is the third case of off-premises data theft that OHSU has reported in recent years. In 2008, they notified 890 patients after a laptop was stolen from an employee attending a conference in Chicago. In 2009, they notified 1,000 patients after a laptop was stolen from a physician’s car parked outside his home.",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0.0,14300.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2012,Oregon State Hospital,OR,PHYS,Other,"The Oregon State Hospital today notified patients that printed documents containing protected patient information were among items stolen from an Oregon State Hospital supervisor’s car on Friday, April 13th.
 
 There were three sets of documents taken, two of which included protected patient information:
 
 1. A printed list of the names, hospital identification numbers, treating physicians and the location of approximately 550 patients housed at the hospital in March. Under federal privacy laws, this information is protected patient information. The list did not contain any information about the patient’s diagnosis or medical history.
 
 2. Approximately 20 progress notes, which had a greater level of detail, including the patients’ dates of birth and health information, such as diagnoses. The progress notes were selected from a random sample of approximately 291 patients.
 
 3. A notebook belonging to the supervisor containing day-to-day work notes.
 
 The Social Security numbers of the patients were not compromised, and no electronic patient information was involved.
 
 OSH staff members are meeting with all patients to inform them of the loss of the documents. The hospital has been unable to identify the names of the patientswhose progress notes were pulled in the random sample, so all 291 will be notified of this potential release of information.
 
 While patient records are secured at the two sites at the state hospital, the incident does point to vulnerabilities when transporting patient information. To that end, Superintendent Roberts has called for a thorough review of all policies and procedures guiding the transportation of patient records and will be making recommendations to increase the safety of patient records.
 
 Patients and their guardians who have questions should talk to their treatment teams or call 1-800-442-5238 (TTY 711).",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0.0,570.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2015,Orlando Health,FL,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"Notice Regarding Unauthorized Access
 
 The privacy and confidentiality of our patient’s health information is of the utmost importance to Orlando Health. Regrettably, this notice is regarding a recent incident involving that information.
 
 On May 27, 2015, while conducting a routine patient record access audit we learned that a certified nursing assistant at Orlando Health was accessing patient records outside their current job responsibilities. We immediately removed the employee’s system access and commenced an investigation. We have been unable to determine the exact information that the employee viewed or the reason for the access. The employee accessed patients’ electronic medical record which may have included patients’ names, dates of birth, addresses, medications, medical tests and results, other clinical information, and the last four digits of social security numbers. In a limited number of patients, the employee may have also accessed insurance information. Based upon our investigation, the employee was terminated by Orlando Health.
 
 This incident did not affect all patients treated at Orlando Health, but only certain patients treated at Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies, Dr. P. Phillips Hospital and a limited number of patients treated at Orlando Regional Medical Center, from January 2014 to May 2015.
 
 While we have no evidence that the information has been used in any way or removed from the hospital, we wanted to notify affected individuals of this incident and let them know that we take it very seriously.
 
 As a precaution, Orlando Health began sending letters to affected patients on July 2, 2015. If you believe you are affected and you do not receive a letter by July 15, please call 1-866-910-5602 Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 9:00 ET Eastern Time. Orlando Health is also encouraging the limited number of individuals who may have had their insurance information accessed to review the explanation of benefits document they receive from the health insurer to verify it does not include any services they did not receive. If it does, they should contact their insurer immediately.
 
 Orlando Health is committed to protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. We are continually evaluating and modifying our practices and the practices of our employees to enhance the security and privacy of all confidential and protected health information entrusted to us. We are also re-educating our workforce members and increasing our already vigilant program of auditing and monitoring of patient record access.
 
 Paul Brinkmann of The Orlando Sentinel reports that 3,200 patients were affected by this incident.
 
 This is not the first incident involving Orlando Health that has been reported on this site and PHIprivacy.net. In February 2013, we learned that an employee of Mid-Florida Urological Associates had been improperly accessing patient information from Orlando Health, In March 2014, there was a report involving a missing flash drive, and in May of this year, we learned that Orlando Health was sending out letters to patients whose protected health information was on a patient list found in a driveway.
 
 Yesterday, Orlando Health reported a (now former) employee illegally accessed the medical records of up to 3,200 patients while employed at the hospital. The data breach was discovered on May 27, 2015, although it took just over a month for breach notices to be issued. The healthcare provider started sending notifications to patients yesterday, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
 
 An investigation was immediately launched upon discovery of the data breach, which rapidly established information had been improperly accessed by the employee. The healthcare provider terminated the employee’s work contract, and the matter has been reported to law enforcement officers.
 
 This is not the first data breach to be suffered by Orlando Health. Another employee was discovered to have improperly accessed patient records in February 2013. In March of last year the company lost a flash drive containing the medical records of 586 children treated at the company’s Arnold Palmer Medical Center. More recently, just two months ago, patient records were found in a neighborhood driveway.
 
 Breach Notification Delay Could Result in State Enforcement Action
 After suffering so many data breaches, Orlando Health’s breach response procedures should be tried and tested; however the healthcare provider waited more than a month to issue breach notices. Under HIPAA regulations, all covered entities have up to 60 days to issue breach notices to victims and alert the media and Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights.
 
 However, Florida data breach laws require healthcare providers to report data breaches to the state Attorney General within 30 days of a data breach occurring, unless there is deemed to be no risk of the data being used for fraudulent purposes.
 
 A statement released by Orlando Health said the investigation determined that “records were improperly accessed but there is no evidence that any data has been copied or used to commit fraud.”
 
 A breach notice is required under HIPAA Rules and this has been issued well within the allowable timeframe, but the delay could potentially violate data breach laws in Florida.
 
 Florida Hospitals Targeted by Tax Fraudsters
 A number of Florida hospital employees have been caught snooping on patient records in recent months. Healthcare data carries a high value on the black market as the records can be used to commit identity, medical and insurance fraud. Criminals are often able to run up many thousands of dollars of debts before the crimes are discovered.
 
 In Florida, data is often stolen for the purpose of filing fake tax returns in the names of victims. In this case, that task would be difficult as only the last four digits of Social Security numbers were viewable. However, there is still a risk of the victims suffering identity fraud as a result of the breach.
 
 The data viewed included the medical insurance information of around 100 patients, adding a risk of insurance fraud for those individuals. Other information exposed included the names of patients, addresses, dates of birth, medical tests taken, and the results of those tests, along with some clinical information.
 
 The patients affected have all previously visited either the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies or the Dr. P. Phillips Hospital. A small percentage of the records related to patients of the Orlando Regional Medical Center. The records corresponded to patients who received medical services between January 2014 and May 2015.
 
 The healthcare provider has set up a dedicated helpline for breach victims and will be offering support services, although it has not been announced whether the cost of credit monitoring and credit protection will be covered by Orlando Health.
 
 July 06, 2015 - An employee’s unauthorized access of 3,200 patient medical records has caused a potential health data breach at Orlando Health.
 During a routine patient record access audit on May 27, 2015, Orlando Health discovered that a certified nursing assistant had inappropriately accessed patient records outside of normal job functions, according to a company statement. While it was not entirely clear what information was viewed, Orlando Health said the data could include patient names, dates of birth, addresses, medications, medical tests and results, other clinical information, and the last four digits of Social Security Numbers.
 
 There were also “a limited number of patients” who may have had their insurance information accessed as well, Orlando Health reported.
 
 The employee’s system access was revoked upon discovery of the incident, and the health organization added that the employee has since been terminated.

 “We are continually evaluating and modifying our practices and the practices of our employees to enhance the security and privacy of all confidential and protected health information entrusted to us,” the statement read. “We are also re-educating our workforce members and increasing our already vigilant program of auditing and monitoring of patient record access.”
 
 Orlando Health explained that not all of its facilities were affected. Only certain patients treated at Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies, Dr. P. Phillips Hospital and a limited number of patients treated at Orlando Regional Medical Center, from January 2014 to May 2015, potentially had their information accessed.
 
 There is no evidence that the information has been used in any way or removed from the hospital, according to Orlando Health.
 
 ""We take this incident very seriously, and we are committed to protecting patients' health and personal information,"" Orlando Health Corporate Director of Compliance and Information Security Steve Stallard said in a statement. ""We deeply regret any concern or inconvenience this may cause our patients or their family members.""
 
 Data breach notification letters began to be sent out on July 2, and Orlando Health urged individuals to reach out if they think they may have been affected and have not received a letter by July 15. Moreover, patients who may have had their insurance information accessed are encouraged to “review the explanation of benefits document they receive from the health insurer to verify it does not include any services they did not receive,"" Orlando Health added.
 
 Unfortunately, this is not the first health data breach that Orlando Health has reported this year. In May, the company reported that patient names may have been compromised after medical information was found in a residential driveway.
 
 In that incident, an Orlando Health employee reportedly took the patient list home by mistake and it is believed that the patient information fell out of the employee’s car. The misplaced list had patient names, medical record numbers, account numbers and even diagnoses.
 
 ""We understand the concerns of patients involved in this incident,” Orlando Health said in its letter. “The privacy and security of our patients’ health information is a top priority for us. We conducted a thorough investigation of the incident and found no evidence of malice or intent.”",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0.0,3421.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 Lost Thumb Drive at Arnold Palmer Medical Center Contains Information on 586 Child Patients
 Wednesday, April 2, 2014
 An unencrypted flash drive containing limited information of 586 children treated at Orlando Health's Arnold Palmer Medical Center between 2009 and 2013, was misplaced, according to the hospital. The lost drive is being treated as a data security breach. However, there is no evidence that any of the information on the flash drive was accessed or used by any unauthorized individual.
 
 As a precaution, on March 24, 2014, the hospital began notifying affected families.
 
 Click here to read the statement on this incident from Arnold Palmer Medical Center.
 
 
 Hospital Speculates Thumb Drive Was Thrown Out.
 
 According to the Orlando Sentinel, on February 12, 2014, the hospital learned that the flash drive was misplaced. The information on the device includes last names, assigned medical record numbers, dates of birth, gestational ages, birth weights, dates of hospitalization, and in some cases, transfer dates of the children who were patients at other hospitals.
 
 To read the entire article from the Orlando Sentinel, click here.
 
 The hospital states that upon learning of the incident, it immediately conducted an unsuccessful search in an attempt to locate the flash drive. The hospital speculates the thumb drive may have been placed in the pocket of a disposable lab coat and mistakenly discarded along with the coat.
 To prevent a similar incident from happening again, the hospital is re-educating its workforce members regarding the use of portable devices and the importance of handling patient information securely.
 
 
 Be Careful With Technical Equipment Containing Internal Memory.
 
 This incident is an important reminder about equipment designed to retain electronic information. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) covered entities are responsible for making sure all personal information is protected.
 
 In today’s technological society everyone must be continually vigilant about the machines and equipment used. Many different types of devices now contain internal memory chips and hard drives that may store data that is difficult to erase. These may include photocopiers, scanners and fax machines, in addition to computers and servers. Security videos and communications monitoring systems may also maintain such information. Backup tapes and modern cell phones are other possible examples. These should be professionally cleaned of all data or destroyed before discarding them, selling them or trading them in for newer models.

2017,Our Lady of the Angels Hospital,LA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"Our Lady of the Angels Hospital Breach Impacts 1,140 Patients
 
 Our Lady of the Angels Hospital has discovered a former employee accessed the medical records of 1,140 patients without authorization.
 
 The employee had been granted access to the protected health information in order to conduct work duties; however, hospital staff became aware the employee was accessing medical records without any legitimate work reason for doing so.
 
 The improper access was discovered on July 25, 2017, and the employee’s access to the medical record system was immediately terminated, as was the employee.
 
 Rene Ragas, President and CEO, Our Lady of the Angels Hospital, said, “Patient privacy is a top priority and we have a zero-tolerance policy for employees who improperly access patient data.”
 
 A thorough investigation was conducted to determine which patients had been impacted, which revealed the former employee had been inappropriately accessing the medical records of patients for more than three years.
 
 The Bogalusa, LA hospital was acquired by the Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System on March 17, 2014, which is the date given for when the improper access first started. A spokesperson for the hospital confirmed to Becker’s Hospital Review that the improper access may have been occurring for up to 15 years, when the hospital was managed by LSU Health under the name LSU Bogalusa Medical Center.
 
 The employee was questioned about the improper access and it does not appear that any patient health information was shared with any other individuals or was used improperly. This appears to be another case of a healthcare employee accessing medical records out of curiosity.
 
 Even though data theft and misuse is not suspected, out of an abundance of caution, all patients whose privacy was violated have been offered 12 months of credit monitoring services without charge.
 
 The types of information accessed by the former employee includes names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, gender, insurance information, social security numbers, diagnoses, dates of services, places of services, and clinical information such as orders, test results, medications, and clinical abstracts.
 
 Our Lady of the Angels Hospital is reviewing policies and procedures and will be revising its audit processes to ensure any future privacy breaches of this nature are identified more rapidly. Additional training is also being provided to employees regarding the privacy and security of PHI.
 
 Our Lady of the Angels Hospital in Louisiana has suffered a data breach affecting more than 1,100 patients after a former employee accessed patients records without authorization. Affected data included names, addresses, contact details, insurance details, Social Security numbers, and medical history, including test results.
 
 Upon discovery of the breach, the employee was sacked and their access to the system terminated with immediate effect. An investigation has revealed that the affected data was accessed between March 17, 2014 and July 25, 2017. It also determined which patients were affected. All affected patients have been informed and have been given 12 months of credit monitoring services.
 
 It appears this is “another case of a healthcare employee accessing medical records out of curiosity.” Accessing confidential patient medical records without a legitimate business reason for doing so is an offence and can incur serious consequences. Employees with access to confidential information cannot just access records because they’re “curious” or because they feel like it.
 
 Rene Ragas, president and CEO at Our Lady of the Angels Hospital, said:
 
 Patient privacy is a top priority and we have a zero-tolerance policy for employees who improperly access patient data. We deeply regret that this happened and we are committed to doing the right thing. We have no evidence indicating that any individual’s personal information has been utilized or misused, but, out of an abundance of caution and transparency, we are proactively informing those who may have been impacted by this incident.
 
 The hospital has responded efficiently to the breach and is taking the matter very seriously. It will be “providing additional education to all employees regarding the privacy and security of confidential patient information.”
 
 Although this breach is an example of a deliberate misuse and not human error, it shows the importance of training staff effectively to ensure that they know how to treat confidential information. The healthcare industry is no stranger to data breaches as 41% of healthcare data breaches reported so far this year have been caused by insiders.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0.0,1140.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center has determined that a laptop computer containing limited health information for former Intensive Care Unit patients was discovered to be missing from a local physician office sometime between March 16 and 20, 2012. An extensive search was initiated as soon as the incident was discovered. Investigation of the incident continues and we have reported this occurrence to law enforcement. We will continue to share updated information. We are sorry this incident occurred and assure our patients and the community that we are committed to protecting patients’ personal information.
 
 The data stored on the laptop computer was being used for a project that required the collection of certain quality and patient outcomes data and covered 17,130 patients in the adult ICU from 2000 to 2008. The data included information such as patient name, age, race, dates of admission and discharge from the Intensive Care Unit, and results of treatment. The data did not include patients’ financial information, social security numbers, addresses, or date of birth. There is no evidence at this time that the information has been misused or that there was any malicious intent.
 
 We regularly review our physical and electronic safeguards to ensure that personally identifiable information remains private and secure. In light of this incident, we are taking additional, aggressive steps to examine new ways to further secure our data and prevent similar occurrences in the future. The plan includes additional education, greater physical and encryption controls and an organization-wide personal device inventory.
 
 In compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), we will inform patients affected through personal letters mailed to their homes beginning May 18, 2012. We have also established a dedicated call center to address patient concerns and questions.The toll free number 1-877-615-3782 will also become operational on May 18, 2012 and will be available from 8:00am to 8:00pm CDT Monday through Saturday. We are providing impacted patients personal credit monitoring services at no cost. Enrollment can be completed using the same toll free number for the call center.

2017,Pacific Alliance Medical Center,CA,HACK,Network Server,"Home / Pacific Alliance Medical Center notifies 266,123 patients of ransomware incident
 
 Notice of Data Breach
 At Pacific Alliance Medical Center (PAMC), we understand that the confidentiality and security of medical and personal information is critically important, and we are committed to protecting it. The purpose of this post is to notify patients and employees of a recent cyber incident that affected PAMC and may have resulted in a compromise of certain electronic files containing medical or personal information.
 
 What Happened
 On June 14, 2017, PAMC became aware that certain of its networked computer systems were being affected by a cyber incident. PAMC suspects that the incident began on or shortly before that date. Shortly after becoming aware of the issue, PAMC’s Information Technology Department completed a preliminary assessment and determined that certain networked computer systems had been infected by a computer virus that was encrypting (making unreadable) certain files on PAMC’s computer network. PAMC promptly shut down its networked computer systems, initiated its incident response and recovery procedures, notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and began a forensic investigation under the direction of its counsel. Since then, PAMC has decrypted (made readable again) the affected files and has taken action to restore the affected systems and prevent similar incidents from occurring.
 
 There is no evidence to date that any unauthorized person has actually viewed, retrieved, copied, or deleted any medical or personal information. Typically, this type of computer virus, known as ransomware, is used to deny access to data and disrupt operations in order to extract money from the data owners—and not to steal data. However, this may not always be the case, and, therefore, as a precaution, PAMC has sent letters by mail to patients and employees whose medical or personal information may have been on servers affected by the virus. PAMC has also notified the California Department of Public Health, the California Attorney General and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights of this incident.
 
 What Information Was Involved
 The medical and personal information on the servers affected by the virus included: names, demographic information, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, employment information, health insurance information, and health information, including, for example, treatment, diagnosis, and related information and medical images.
 
 What We Are Doing
 We have strengthened our virus detection and other systems and safeguards to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to our systems. We have also taken other steps to try to prevent similar incidents in the future. As an extra precautionary measure, PAMC has provided potentially affected individuals with access to identity theft protection services for two years at no charge. Instructions for enrolling in credit monitoring were included in the notification letters and can also be obtained by calling the toll-free number listed below.
 
 What You Can Do
 PAMC advises patients and employees to remain vigilant by regularly reviewing their account statements, monitoring free credit reports, and reporting to their financial institutions any suspicious activity. Patients and employees may obtain a free copy of their credit report online at www.annualcreditreport.com, by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, or by mailing an Annual Credit Report Request Form (available at www.annualcreditreport.com) to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA, 30348-5281.
 
 For More Information
 PAMC has made available a toll-free number for patients and employees to call if they have any questions or wish to obtain additional information, (877) 890-9332. The hotline operating hours are from 6am to 6pm PST, Monday through Friday, and 8am to 5pm PST, Saturday and Sunday, excluding major holidays.

2019,Palmetto Health,SC,HACK,Email,"Palmetto Health addresses phishing incident
 
 COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA—Palmetto Health is notifying individuals of an email phishing incident that resulted in unauthorized access to individual email boxes. The incident was limited to certain employee email accounts, and did not affect our medical record systems. We believe the purpose of the unauthorized access was to gain access to payroll information.
 
 Upon discovery, we blocked the unauthorized access and then engaged outside technical experts to investigate the incident thoroughly to evaluate the full nature and scope of the access. These experts determined that unauthorized access may have first occurred this past November. They also searched to determine whether sensitive data was located within any of the potentially accessed emails. These same emails were also hand reviewed to obtain names and mailing addresses for use in notification.
 
 After completing this extensive review process, on February 19, 2019, we were alerted to the names of the individuals whose information was within the accounts – which contained some patient names and other patient information typically used by a health care provider in the course of providing treatment or consultation. A lesser portion of the emails contained social security numbers and medical insurance information.
 
 Phishing involves a scammer sending an email that looks perfectly legitimate, but in reality, the email has a malicious link or document within it that, when accessed, allows the scammer to gain the recipient’s email account/passwords – often without the knowledge of the email account owner.
 
 Palmetto Health values the safety and security of patient and employee information and is continuing to take steps to enhance its security measures to help prevent something like this from happening in the future. We attempted to notify by letter at the last known address and by substitute notice every person who was affected by this incident. While we have no evidence that any patient information contained in the affected email accounts has been used inappropriately, we are offering complimentary identity theft protection services to those whose financial data could have been accessed. We recommend affected persons to remain vigilant and monitor account statements and credit reports carefully and to report discrepancies to law enforcement. Fraud alerts and security freezes also can be activated to help protect individuals.

 Every time I think I’m ready to total out the March data on health data attacks or incidents, another incident pops up belatedly on HHS’s site. This time, there were two reports that I had to add yesterday.
 
 One was a report from Palmetto Health in South Carolina (now part of Prisma). Palmetto reported that a phishing attack sometime in November, 2018 necessitated months of investigation.

2014,Palo Verde Hospital,CA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"Palo Verde Healthcare reports internal data breach
 
 March 03, 2014 - The Palo Verde Healthcare District (PVHD) recently alerted an unknown number of patients with letters that a HIPAA violation had occurred involving their protected health information (PHI). Four former PVHD administrator employees a civil lawsuit filed against PVHD in July 2013, according to paloverdevalleytimes.com, and included the patients’ records within their findings.
 
 PVHD first learned of the documents when they were produced to its legal counsel by the plaintiffs’ attorneys in late December 2013. Most of the affected patients had received care at some point between 2010 and 2012, according to PVHD CEO Sandra Anaya. “The lawsuit relates to the end of the plaintiffs’ employment as PVHD administrators. The patient-related documents were produced as evidence by the attorneys for the former administrators in the lawsuit,” said Anaya in the report.
 
 
 Anaya went on to say that PVHD considers patient privacy essential to quality healthcare and that the hospital is evaluating its patient privacy systems and procedures. “This is in effort to ensure that an event like this does not ever occur again,” said Anaya.
 
 PVHD has also alerted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the breach. This breach is difficult to quantify because we know so little of the circumstances involved with the patient records in terms of policy, access and safeguards. The records appeared to be in paper form, so an important part of the equation for HHS will be the measures PVHD took in physically and administratively safeguarding the records. “We want to maintain the integrity of the relationship between our hospital and the community of patients which it has served for nearly half a century,” said Anaya.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,180.0,1100.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2014,Palomar Health,CA,Theft,Other,"Notice to Palomar Health Patients Regarding Stolen Flash Drives
 Palomar Health is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of our patients’ information and we regret to inform you of an incident involving some of that information.
 
 On February 22, 2014, Palomar Health learned that two flash drives were stolen from an employee’s vehicle overnight. We immediately began a thorough investigation, including hiring an outside expert forensic company to reconstruct the information contained on the flash drives. The investigation concluded on March 25, 2014 and determined that the flash drives may have contained patients’ names, dates of birth, diagnoses, treatment information, and insurance information (including Medicare identification numbers). Patients’ financial information and medical records were not on the flash drives.
 
 This incident did not affect all Palomar Health patients, only certain patients treated since 2008.
 
 We have no knowledge that this information has been used in any way; however, as a precaution, we will begin sending letters to affected patients on March 28, 2014. We have also established a dedicated call center which will be active beginning on March 28, 2014. If you believe you may be affected but did not receive a letter by April 18, 2014, or if you have any questions, please call 1-866-313-7993 Monday through Friday between 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time.
 
 We deeply regret any inconvenience this may cause our patients. To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, Palomar Health is reinforcing education with our staff on the importance of handling and securing our patients’ information.
 
 Update: There’s been an arrest in the case and the flash drives have been recovered.
 
 ESCONDIDO — About 5,000 patients of Palomar Health had personal information — including medical diagnoses — stolen last month when someone swiped a company laptop and two flash drives from an employee’s SUV, a company official announced Friday.
 The inland North County health care system is reaching out to patients affected by the late February theft of the items, spokeswoman Bobette Brown said. Palomar Health runs Palomar Medical Center in Escondido and Pomerado Hospital in Poway.
 
 The laptop was encrypted, but the two flash drives were not, Brown said.
 
 Oceanside police recovered the laptop last week, and on Friday may have found the missing flash drives during a search of a home in Vista. One person was arrested, and at least one more arrest may follow in the coming days, police Sgt. Matt Cole said.
 
 The flash drives contained the personal information of more than 5,000 patients, including their names, dates of birth, and information related to their diagnoses, treatments and insurance. It also included 36 Medicare identification numbers. Neither medical records nor financial information were on the stolen flash drives, Brown said.
 
 The theft affected only certain patients treated by the health care system since 2008, according to Brown.
 
 As of Friday, Palomar Health had no reports that any of the stolen data had been used.
 
 Kim Jackson, privacy officer for Palomar Health, said the company has been working with staffers to help prevent a similar type of incident, and is taking a fresh look at methods to ensure safeguards to patient privacy.
 
 “Palomar Health takes this matter very seriously and is committed to protecting patient privacy, and we deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused our patients,” Jackson said.
 
 Brown said the employee had taken the laptop and flash drives home to do work after-hours. She declined to comment on what disciplinary action, if any, was taken with the employee.
 
 The theft happened late Feb. 21 or early Feb. 22 from the employee’s SUV, parked at their home in east Oceanside.
 
 On March 17, a tracking device led police to the computer at the home of a person who had bought it, not knowing it was a stolen item, Cole said.
 
 Further investigation led police on Friday to search the Vista home of a woman believed to be tied to the sale of the stolen computer. The woman, identified as Jasmine Baker, 24, was arrested on suspicion of possession of stolen property. A second suspect also may be arrested, Cole said.
 
 During the search of Baker’s home, police found what they suspect may be the missing flash drives. They also found other items suspected to be stolen property, Cole said.
 
 After learning of the theft last month, Palomar Health hired an outside firm to reconstruct the information on the flash drives. That work was completed on Monday, and the hospital began reaching out to the affected patients Friday.
 
 Patients affected by the theft can reach the health care system for more information and help at (866) 313-7993. The company is offering credit monitoring to those whose Medicare numbers were stolen.

2009,Peninsula Orthopaedic Associates,MD,PORT,Other,"SALISBURY -- As many as 100,000 patients of Peninsula Orthopaedic Associates are being warned to protect themselves against identity theft after tapes containing patient information were stolen.
 
 
 In a letter mailed this week, Chief Executive Officer Brian K. Mathias told patients they should place 90-day fraud alerts on their accounts at the three major credit bureaus.
 
 Patients also were advised to keep an eye on benefits statements from their health insurance companies since they may also be at risk for medical identity theft.
 
 ""What a mess,"" said Ann Suthkowski of Salisbury, who was treated at Peninsula Orthopaedic more than two years ago for bone fractures.
 
 Suthkowski said she planned to give copies of the letter to her attorney and her health insurer as a precaution.
 
 Another Salisbury resident, Theresa Flores, said her daughter, her husband and parents all got letters, too. Since her daughter is only 12 and probably has no credit history, Flores said she's not sure if she needs to report it to the credit bureaus.
 
 ""I am a little concerned, and I don't know what to do,"" she said.
 
 The records from Peninsula Orthopaedic -- which has offices in Salisbury and Berlin -- were stolen March 25 while in transport to an off-site storage facility, Mathias said in the letter.
 
 ""While this information was stored in a proprietary database format and would not be readily accessible to the average person without specialized equipment or software, it is capable of being accessed by a third party,"" Mathias wrote.
 
 Patients' personal information including their Social Security numbers, employers and health insurance plan numbers may have been among the information stolen.
 
 ""Our patients' privacy is a top priority for Peninsula Orthopaedic Associates,"" Mathias said in an e-mail to The Daily Times on Friday. ""We were notified of a potential security breach on March 25th and began working immediately with law enforcement to investigate this matter thoroughly and quickly.We have notified all of our patients and they can call with questions anytime. At this point, there is no evidence that any of our patients' information has been compromised.Since the matter is now in the hands of law enforcement, we are not at liberty to discuss the ongoing investigation.""
 
 A spokeswoman for the 56-year-old practice also declined to release any more details because of the ongoing police investigation.
 
 However, she re-emphasized there is no evidence so far than any of the information has been accessed or misused.

2018,Penn Medicine,PA,Theft,Laptop,"1. enn Medicine of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania’s unencrypted laptop containing Personal Health Information (PHI) of almost 1,000 patients was stolen leading to the HIPAA violation.

The theft occurred on November 30, 2017, in the King of Prussia Mall parking lot when the laptop was kept in the car. Penn Medicine took help from Upper Merion Township police and an internet service provider to locate the missing computer.

“In addition to working with the police, we have worked with the computer manufacturer as well as relevant internet service providers to determine if there is any evidence that the laptop has been turned on and/or accessed. To date, there is no indication that either has occurred, and the laptop is protected by a strong password,” the statement read.

The personal information of the patients that was stored in the laptop consisted of patient names, dates of birth, medical records and patient account numbers, and some demographic and medical information. No social security Numbers, credit card, bank account information, or contact information was included on the laptop.As per the Penn Medicine Academic Services User Responsibilities, every laptop containing “Sensitive or Confidential data” should be encrypted.

Even the computer security policy of Penn Medicine requires Sensitive personally identifiable information to be part of protected health information including demographic data, a patient’s mental health or physical condition, a patient’s provision of health care, and a patient’s payment for provision of health care paired with an identifier such as a name, address, phone number, or account number.

As the unencrypted laptop consisted of this information, it is a violation of the University’s Computer Security Policy.

This violation can result in regulatory fines, lawsuits, reputational damage, and the loss of trust by critical members of the community. Risks for the patients whose information was on the laptop include “identity theft, embarrassment, harassment, and other problems.”

Penn Medicine has informed all the impacted patients through email notification informing them about the theft of an unencrypted laptop.
2. A non-encrypted Penn Medicine laptop with personal information of about 1,000 patients was stolen on Nov. 30, reported Philly.com.

The laptop was stolen from a car in the King of Prussia Mall parking lot over a month ago, and Penn Medicine has been working with Upper Merion Township police and an internet service provider to locate the missing computer. 

Penn Medicine sent a letter to patients whose personal information was stored in a file on the unencrypted laptop, notifying them that the device was stolen, a Penn Medicine spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement. 

The information stored on the laptop included patient names, dates of birth, medical records and patient account numbers, and some demographic and medical information, but did not include social security numbers, credit card, bank account information, or contact information, according to the statement.

""In addition to working with the police, we have worked with the computer manufacturer as well as relevant internet service providers to determine if there is any evidence that the laptop has been turned on and/or accessed. To date, there is no indication that either has occurred, and the laptop is protected by a strong password,"" the statement read. 

The Penn Medicine Academic Services User Responsibilities requires that all laptops with ""Sensitive or Confidential data"" be encrypted.  

Penn's Computer Security Policy further defines ""Sensitive Personally Identifieable Information"" to include protected health information such as demographic data, a patient's mental health or physical condition, a patient's provision of health care, and a patient's payment for provision of health care paired with an identifier such as a name, address, phone number, or account number.

The information on the stolen laptop falls under this category of ""Sensitive or Confidential data"" — the unencrypted laptop thereby is a violation of the University's Computer Security Policy.

Consequences of this violation outlined in the Computer Security Policy could cause Penn, its schools, and its centers ""regulatory fines, lawsuits, reputational damage, and the loss of trust by critical members of our community."" Risks for the patients whose information was on the laptop include ""identity theft, embarrassment, harassment, and other problems.""

The policy, which became effective Feb. 9, 2016, cites any breach of Penn Security Policy as a threat to the integrity of the research and teaching contained on Penn's computing infrastructure.

2019,Penn Medicine,PA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"1. Penn Medicine officials said Tuesday that a former medical assistant at the hospital system had accessed patient records improperly and allegedly “misused” one patient’s information.

Lauren Steinfeld, Penn Medicine’s chief privacy officer, said in a statement that the assistant was a contract employee, hired through a staffing agency, and worked at Penn from February through late April. She did not provide the name of the employee, or the name of the person’s department.

On April 29, Penn learned that the employee had accessed patient records “without a work-related reason,” Steinfeld said.

“The information accessed may have included demographic and clinical information and in some cases, may have included Social Security numbers,” Steinfeld said.

Steinfeld said she was aware of one patient whose information was “misused,"" but did not specify how the information had been used. Still, the employee had contact with about 900 patients’ records while employed at Penn Medicine, and the hospital system has contacted all of the patients about the breach, Steinfeld said.
2. A former Penn medical assistant allegedly accessed patient records improperly and misused a patient’s information, the Philly Inquirer reported. 

Penn Medicine informed nearly 900 patients with records accessible to the former employee, according to the Inquirer. Law enforcement was also notified.

Penn Medicine chief privacy officer Lauren Steinfeld said in a statement to the Philly Inquirer that Penn discovered on April 29 the medical assistant had accessed patient records “without a work-related reason."" Steinfeld added that the medical assistant was a contract employee who worked at Penn from February to late April 2019.

“The information accessed may have included demographic and clinical information and, in some cases, may have included Social Security numbers,” Steinfeld said, according to the Philly Inquirer.

Steinfeld said the employee “misused” one patient’s information but did not elaborate on how it was misused, Becker's Hospital Review reported. She also omitted the employee’s name and department.

Penn Medicine added new monitoring software in May 2018 to strengthen the security of patient data and detect suspicious activity. Since then, the software has detected privacy violations that have resulted in employment terminations. 

When Penn Medicine announced the addition of the new monitoring software, they said, for example, if an employee who normally does not access medication lists unexpectedly accesses the medication list of a minor patient, the Privacy Office will be sent an alert to prompt an investigation.

Steinfeld said Penn Medicine will review its use of contract employees to ensure they ""meet and maintain our high professional standards.”

2014,Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,PA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Email,"Penn State Hershey Medical Center said it has notified 1,801 patients of a privacy breach, after it was discovered an employee had been working with protected health information from his home computer.

Officials at the hospital said in a press release Friday afternoon that results of an extensive internal investigation give no indication that any unauthorized person actually viewed or accessed the information as a result of the employee’s activity.

But because the employee worked with the data on devices and systems outside the safeguards and controls of the secure information network, they cannot completely rule out the possibility.Officials said the information is related to a type of test ordered by medical practitioners who used Penn State Hershey laboratories for testing between August 2013 and March 26.

Specifically, the files contained patient names, medical record numbers, the name of lab tests, visit dates and test results. Social Security numbers and financial information were not included.The press release states that the employee responsible for the potential breach was authorized to access and use the information because of his job at Penn State Hershey.

However, he was not permitted to upload the data on a removable storage device to view on his personal computer at home after hours. He then used his personal email account to send the updated test log to two Penn State Hershey physicians.

It seems certain patient information is missing from the Ultrasound Department at Penrose, so it's contacting those affected and working with the Colorado Springs Police Department.

A spokesperson tells 11 News Penrose hospital on N. Nevada Ave. in Colorado Springs is the only Penrose-St. Francis facility affected.

The missing documents reportedly include sensetive information like names and social security numbers. Also included are addresses and medical information, but not full patient records. The Colorado Springs Police Department is also investigating the incident.

Penrose is also offering those patients free identity theft protection. We're told several patients have signed up for the service but no one has reported any fraudulent activity on their accounts.

The hospital is no longer printing out tracking reports with sensetive information. Below is the release sent out Friday just before noon by Penrose-St. Francis:COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – Recently, officials at Penrose-St. Francis Health Services learned that patient information in the Ultrasound Department at Penrose Hospital was missing. The missing documents included demographic and medical information for certain patients seen during August and early September. These are not full patient health records.

Penrose-St. Francis is conducting an internal investigation. In addition, Penrose-St. Francis has notified the Colorado Springs Police Department and the Office for Civil Rights regarding the incident.

Penrose-St. Francis is offering each affected patient a free service with Kroll, a New York-based risk consulting firm and a global leader in data security that offers a package for identity protection. A letter with detailed information has been sent to all of the affected patients’ homes.

“Penrose-St. Francis takes very seriously the responsibility of protecting our patients’ health and private information,” said Larry Seidl, PSF Facility Compliance Officer. “It’s a top priority and in the event we determine information is missing or has been misused, we will take all appropriate legal, personnel and corrective actions.”

2019,Perry County Medical Center INC d/b/a Three Rivers Community Health Group,TN,HACK,Email,"Perry County Medical Center Notifying Patients Following Phishing Attack
Posted By Defensorum on Aug 7, 2019

Perry County Medical Center, Inc. d/b/a Three Rivers Community Health Group, has announced that it is notifying patients following a phishing attack which saw patient data compromised. 

Perry Country Medical Center, a health care centre based in Linden, Tennessee, noticed suspicious activity on an employee email account on May 28, 2019. The IT department were quickly notified, and it was discovered that an unauthorized individual had gained access to the employee email account after the employee had responded to a phishing email. 

The organization contacted experts in cybersecurity assist with the aftermath of the breach. Following an investigation into the compromised email account, the experts discovered the employee’s email account contained a spreadsheet which contained a large quantity of patient information. This information included names, dates of birth, dates of service, physicians’ names, prescription information, health insurance group, and ID numbers may have been accessed. The hacker could not access financial information or Social Security numbers.

According to Perry Country Medical Center’s website, they collected the health information in through a 340B drug pricing program run by the federal government which ‘requires prescription drug manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs to certain health care organizations at a reduced cost’. 

The cybersecurity experts did not find evidence to suggest that hackers accessed, altered or exfiltrated patient data. As of writing, Perry Country Medical Center has yet to uncover any instances of identity theft or misuse of PHI. 

As neither financial information nor Social Security numbers were affected by the breach, the patients are at low risk of becoming victims of fraud. However, Perry Country Medical Center still treated the incidence as a data breach and are following HIPAA’s Breach Notification Rule by sending all affected patients notification letters once all affected individuals have been identified. 

Furthermore, out of an abundance of caution, all affected individuals have been offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.

The attack has prompted a review of privacy and security controls. Perry Country Medical Center has stated that they intend to enhance its cybersecurity framework by implementing measures to enhance email security. 

Perry Country Medical Center have not released a figure for the number of patients affected by the breach.

Healthcare information has a high black market value, and therefore, even small or medium-sized healthcare organizations are potentially lucrative targets to hackers. It only takes a single employee falling for a phishing campaign for a network to be compromised and for patient information to be placed at risk. Extensive employee training is needed to mitigate the risk of a phishing attack being successful. ",1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,60.0,3812.0,381200.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2018,Port City Operating Company doing business as St. Joseph's Medical Center,CA,Loss,Other,"1. ST. JOSEPH'S MEDICAL CENTER LOSES DISK DRIVES WITH LAB RESULTS
California-based St. Joseph’s Medical Center reported to OCR on Aug. 31 that portable electronic devices containing PHI of 4,984 individuals were lost.

On its website, the hospital elaborated that lab chemistry tests performed at the facility in April 2018 were saved on two disk drives that were lost. Information on the disks included patient name, date of birth, nursing unit location, account number, gender, type of lab tests and results, and name of doctor who ordered the tests.

“There is no indication that the information has been accessed or used for any wrong purpose,” the hospital explained.

Although the information was not encrypted, the “hard drives used a highly specialized computer operating system, such that the information on the hard drives would not be easy to read or understand.”

St. Joseph’s Medical Center is part of the Dignity Health organization, which operates 39 hospitals and 400 ancillary care facilities in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
2. Notice of Privacy Incident
St. Joseph’s Medical Center is committed to protecting our patient’s medical information.  This commitment includes notifying individuals if we believe that any personal information may have been compromised.  

On August 9, 2018, St. Joseph’s discovered that two old laboratory machine analyzers, powered down for removal and replacement, did not contain their computer hard drives. Personnel of St. Joseph’s and TriMedx, a business associate of St. Joseph’s, searched diligently, but without success, for the hard drives, which contained limited patient information. We now believe the two hard drives were mislaid and cannot be located.  

The hard drives contained information about laboratory chemistry tests performed at St. Joseph’s during a one month period. We believe that there may have been unencrypted information on the hard drive. The information in the hard drives included:

demographic information: name, date of birth, nursing unit location (if hospital patient), account number, and gender; and
clinical information: the type of lab test(s) performed, the test results, and the name of the doctor who ordered the test(s).
There was no financial information, social security numbers or insurance information on the hard drives. There is no indication that the information has been accessed by anyone or was used for any wrong purpose. In addition, the hard drives used a highly specialized computer operating system, such that the information on the hard drives would not be easy to read or understand.  As a result, we do not believe that those affected need to take any action at this time.  

We have started the process of notifying those individuals who may have been impacted, including hospital patients, and patients who may have had their blood drawn at their doctor’s office or another location",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,4984.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2019,Presbyterian Healthcare Services,NM,HACK,Email,"1. New Mexico-based Presbyterian Healthcare Services is notifying approximately 183,000 patients and health plan members that some of their protected health information (PHI) has been exposed in a recent security breach.

On or around May 6, 2019, several Presbyterian Healthcare Services employees received phishing emails. Certain employees responded to the emails and inadvertently disclosed their credentials to the attackers. Those credentials were used to gain access to accounts containing sensitive information such as names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.

Presbyterian Healthcare Services became aware of the breach on June 9 and immediately secured the affected accounts. The breach investigation uncovered no evidence to suggest any personal information was accessed or stolen by the attacker and no reports been received to suggest any PHI has been misused.

Affected individuals have been offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 12 months and have been advised to monitor their accounts and explanation of benefits statements carefully for any sign of fraudulent activity.

Presbyterian Healthcare Services is taking steps to improve email security to prevent any further breaches of this nature in the future.
2. New Mexico-based Presbyterian Healthcare Services is notifying 183,000 patients that their personal and medical information was potentially breached after a month-long phishing attack.

On June 6, Presbyterian officials discovered a hacker gained access to several employee email accounts beginning a month earlier on May 9. Access began through a phishing scam focused on gaining information.

Upon discovery, the accounts were secured, and officials said they launched a review into the impacted emails. Law enforcement was also contacted.The investigation determined the compromised accounts contained patient and health plan member information including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and health plan and or clinical information. All patients will receive a year of free credit monitoring and identity protection services.

Officials stressed the hack did not impact Presbyterian’s electronic health records or billing systems.

Presbyterian will be implementing additional security measures to its email system. Further, employees will now be required to successfully complete mandatory training around safeguarding data, including education on phishing scams and protecting electronically stored data.
3. New Mexico’s Presbyterian Healthcare Services was the victim of a phishing attack on its email system that affected 183,370 individuals, according to the Department of Health and Human Services breach portal.

The not-for-profit healthcare system, with nine hospitals, a multi-specialty medical group with more than 900 providers and a statewide health plan, reported that last month it discovered “unauthorized access was gained through a deceptive email” to some of its staff.


The breach, which occurred around May 9, did not affect Presbyterian’s electronic health records or billing systems. However, the unauthorized access to workforce members’ email accounts included patient and health plan member names and might have contained dates of birth, Social Security numbers and clinical or health plan information, according to a statement from the healthcare organization.“Presbyterian believes that the unauthorized access to these email accounts was part of a ‘phishing’ scam trying to get information,” states the notification. “Once Presbyterian became aware of this incident, it secured these email accounts, began a thorough review of the impacted emails and alerted federal law enforcement.”

“Presbyterian believes that the unauthorized access to these email accounts was part of a ‘phishing’ scam trying to get information,” states the notification. “Once Presbyterian became aware of this incident, it secured these email accounts, began a thorough review of the impacted emails and alerted federal law enforcement.”

While Presbyterian said it is not aware of any improper use or attempted use of the breached email information, the organization recommended that patients potentially impacted by the phishing attack review the statements they receive from their health plan or healthcare providers regarding medical services.

“If you see any service that you believe you did not receive, please contact the health plan or provider immediately,” emphasizes the notification. “To help prevent this incident from happening again, Presbyterian is taking several steps and implementing additional security measures to further protect our email system.”

In addition, the organization reported that all of its staff must successfully complete mandatory training each year about the importance and requirement to safeguard all information.

“In particular, workforce members have received, and will continue to receive, reminders about safeguarding information stored electronically and how to avoid phishing scams,” concluded the announcement. “We want to assure you that Presbyterian is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of every individual’s information.”

What was the response? The hospital plans to offer victims one year of identity-theft protection services.

Details:Police on March 7 arrested Todd Irvine, 43,  of La Habra on charges he stole the computer. The machine was in the possession of Systematic Automation, a vendor responsible for sending information to health insurance providers on behalf of hospital workers.

2014,Presence Health,IL,Loss,Paper/Films,"1. Chicago-based Presence Health agreed to implement a corrective action play and pay $475,000 to HHS' Office for Civil Rights to settle claims that the health system violated HIPAA.

This is the first HIPAA settlement based on a health system's untimely reporting of a breach of unsecured patient information.

On Oct. 22, 2013, the health system discovered operating room schedules were missing from the Presence Surgery Center at Joliet, Ill.-based Presence St. Joseph Medical Center. The schedules contained the personal information of 836 patients, including names, birthdates, medical record numbers, dates and types of procedures, surgeon names and types of anesthesia.

The OCR received a breach notification report from Presence Health on Jan. 31, 2014. After investigating the incident, the OCR deduced that the health system failed to notify affected patients, social media outlets and the OCR of the breach within 60 days of discovering it.

""Covered entities need to have a clear policy and procedures in place to respond to the Breach Notification Rule's timeliness requirements,"" said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. ""Individuals need prompt notice of a breach of their unsecured PHI so they can take action that could help mitigate any potential harm caused by the breach.""

When contacted for comment, a Presence Health spokesperson issued the following comment to Becker's Hospital Review: ""Because patient privacy is a top priority at Presence Health, we are working diligently with the OCR on all steps required under the corrective action plan, including additional associate training in HIPAA policies and procedures. This is the culmination of a several year process working with the OCR to resolve a matter we voluntarily reported to the OCR in 2014 related to an isolated incident involving paper records at a surgery center located in Joliet, Ill. This incident did not involve any electronic records and did not involve any disclosure of patient contact or financial information. We are confident that reports on our progress to quickly implement revised policies and procedures will be positive.
2. The failure to timely report a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHI) has cost Presence Health (one of the largest health systems in Illinois) almost half of a million dollars.

Earlier this month, Presence Health agreed to pay $475,000 and enter into a corrective action plan (CAP) with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) based upon its failure to timely report a data breach in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and HIPAA’s Breach Notification Rule.

On October 22 2013, Presence Health discovered that paper-based operating room schedules were missing from the Presence Surgery Center at the Presence St. Joseph Medical Center in Joliet, Illinois. The schedules contained PHI, including the names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, dates of procedures, types of procedures, surgeon names, and types of anesthesia used for 836 Presence Health patients. Presence Health did not notify OCR of the data breach until January 31, 2014 when Presence Health submitted a breach notification report.

During its subsequent investigation, OCR found that Presence Health failed to timely notify: (i) each of the 836 individuals affected by the breach, (ii) prominent media outlet(s), and (iii) OCR. HIPAA requires covered entities (and business associates) to report breaches without unreasonably delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of a breach.

OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels said “[c]overed entities need to have a clear policy and procedures in place to respond to the Breach Notification Rule’s timeliness requirement…Individuals need prompt notice of a breach of their unsecured PHI so they can take action that could help mitigate any potential harm caused by the breach.”

The Presence Health settlement and CAP provide an important lesson for covered entities.

A breach of PHI can occur at any time, even if it is unintentional and outside of a covered entity’s control. As such, covered entities need to be ready. Covered entities need to have policies and procedures in place so that they can promptly determine whether an incident constitutes a breach of PHI and if it does, they can respond appropriately under the Breach Notification Rule.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,104.0,836.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

The breach resulted from an employee accidently attaching a patient-data filled file to six potential job applicants. In an interview with NBC San Diego, Rady Children’s Hospital President Donald Kearns said, “Unfortunately when the file was emailed, attached to it was the original file, it was complete human error.”

The hospital responded quickly and responsibly by calling and notifying all 14,121 affected by the breach.  While no credit card or social security numbers were included, the names, birth dates, diagnoses, medical records and insurance carrier claim information of patients were all sent out.
2. Rady Children's Hospital spends lots of time and money protecting its patient information from outside hackers. But it was a mistake by an employee that recently exposed the information of more than 14,100 patients.

""Unfortunately when the file was emailed, attached to it was the original file, it was complete human error,"" explained Rady Children's Hospital acting President Donald Kearns.

The attachment was sent to potential job applicants for an internal evaluation. But instead of sending approved information, a collection of real patient data was released to six applicants.

2011,Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center,CA,PORT,Other,"1. L.A. County's Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in Downey recently suffered some memory loss of its own when it was discovered that a laptop with the names, dates of birth and treatment information of 667 patients over nearly 4 years has gone “missing.”

Oops. But wait, there's more:

While, normally, like, if our medical laptop went missing, you wouldn't be able to get much because our good stuff is behind a password, this particular set of patient info was “unencrypted,” a Health Services rep told the Weekly.

So even if whomever ended up with the thing was just after a quick sale on Craigslist, say, all those names, all that intimately private info, might have been out there for the browsing.

The county Department of Health Services is making the breach known under federal law.

Patient info spanned from July , 2007 to Feb. 17, 2011. On Feb. 23 the laptop went missing from a patient diagnostic area, the DHS states. The next day the sheriff's department notified. And more than month later, priorities being what they are, you get to know.

(Actually, the department says patients were mailed a letter about this March 1).

On top of all that, DHS says it's retraining employees on laptop security, we presume, and making sure all such data is encrypted from now on. Wow, DHS, just keep it in the cloud already. Ever heard of Google Documents?

Anyway, here's the quote from DHS director Mitchell Katz:

As a health care organization we are committed to protecting patient privacy and take great steps to ensure the security of electronic health information, We have a duty to protect patients' medical information, and we have implemented measures to prevent a future occurrence of this type.
2. A laptop computer containing more than 660 patient names and diagnostic information was stolen last month from Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center in Downey, Los Angeles County health officials confirmed Friday.

At least 667 patient records were on the stolen laptop, which included names, dates of birth and medical record information, said county Department of Health Services spokesman Michael Wilson.

The laptop was not encrypted, and had been attached to a complex piece of diagnostic machinery that performs electromyographies.

Staff members at the county-run hospital became aware of the stolen laptop Feb. 24, Wilson said, and letters have since been sent alerting patients affected by the theft.

Anyone with questions or information about the breach is asked to call the county at (877) 726-2461,
4. DOWNEY - A laptop computer believed stolen from Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center contained private, unencrypted information on 667 Rancho patients, county health officials announced Tuesday.The laptop was discovered missing Feb. 23 from a hospital diagnostic area. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department launched an investigation on Feb. 24 and classified the incident as a theft, officials said. The laptop contained personal patient information, including the patient's name, date of birth, medical record number, treating physician, test date, referring physician, history of present illness, diagnosis, recommendations and report of electromyography (EMG) testing. No financial or social security information was contained in the laptop, officials said. The laptop contained information on patients who received care at the hospital between July 2007 and February 17, 2011. Patients impacted by the breach were initially notified by first class mail the week of March 1, authorities said. A second notification was scheduled to be sent this week, along with information on how patients could protect themselves from potential harm. Impacted patients were encouraged to contact the three major credit bureaus, including Experian (888) 397-3742, Transunion (800) 680-7289 and Equifax (800) 525-6285. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, which operates Rancho, said it has enhanced hospital security, retrained staff, initiated a campus-wide privacy and security risk assessment and verified that all inventoried laptops are encrypted in compliance with county policy. ""As a healthcare organization we are committed to protecting patient privacy and take great steps to ensure the security of electronic health information,"" said Mitchell Katz, MD, director of the Department of Health Services. ""We have a duty to protect patients' medical information and we have implemented measures to prevent a future occurrence of this type.

(KWCH) Personal health information, social security numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, driver’s license numbers, biometric data, and passport information could all have been exposed to hackers, according to Ransom Memorial Hospital in Ottawa.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights reports on September 25, the hospital fell victim to an outside hack that left thousands of people's information affected.

The hospital says, ""The attack may have exposed 16,366 individuals, including 15,111 individuals in the state of Kansas.""

""The most important thing is that this issue has no impact on patient care,” said Brenda Pfizenmaier, Director of PR, Wellness, Diabetes & Nutrition in a release on the hospital's website. “Security is a top priority for our health care institution. Nothing leads us to believe that this information is in the hands of someone it should not be and there is no indication that any associated information is being bought or sold on the Internet. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying those potentially affected and offering them one year of credit monitoring at no charge.”Ransom Memorial Hospital says state and federal investigators are aware of the attack. The hospital says there is no evidence any of the information has been misused at this point.

2013,Regional Medical Center,TN,Unauthorized Disclosure,Email,"May 13, 2013 - The sending of three emails including personally identifiable information of patients between October 2012 and February 2013 has led the Regional Medical Center in Memphis (the MED) to report a health data breach, according to a public notice issued by the healthcare organization on May 9, 2013. The details from the notice are sparse. The organization determined on March 15, 2013, that three emails were sent on Oct. 29, 2012; Nov. 1, 2013; and Feb. 4, 2013. Each contained some protected health information (PHI) of patients receiving outpatient physician therapy treatment between May 1, 2012, and Jan. 31, 2013. The information comprising this PHI included the following items:patient’s name,
 • patient account number,
 • date of birth,
 • Social Security number,
 • home phone number, and
 • type/reason for PT services The MED is asking that patients who received services during the aforementioned period of time and have not received a notification letter contact the organization for more information by phone: (855) 716-3627 for more information. The Memphis-based organization does not believe that any PHI has been misused or that information has been disclosed inappropriately although it is offering a year’s worth of free credit monitoring to those potentially affected by the improper disclosure.

 Patient Health Data Second-Most Stolen Data Type, Says Study
 A report by WREG’s Adam Hammond puts the figure of potentially patients at 1,200. The MED told WREG that a list of patient medical records were “accidently attached” to an email and sent.
 
 In a copy of the patient notification letter acquired by WREG, the MED has indicated that is working “closely with the company that received the emails, and it is believed the emails were deleted and not further used or disclosed at the time of the incident.” The company receiving the information in error has not been identified.
 
 Likewise, the MED has deemed the health data breach as “innocent” blunder by an employee: The medical center believes this was an innocent employee mistake and has not received any indication that patient information has been used or further disclosed in an inappropriate manner by anyone. However, in an abundance of caution, the medical center is notifying affected patients of this incident by letter and has retained a specialty firm to provide one year of free credit monitoring services to affected patients. While the medical center maintains a robust privacy and security compliance program, it also has taken internal steps to help ensure this does not happen again.",1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,137.0,1200.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2013,Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point,FL,DISC,Other,"Healthcare organizations may want to take long looks at mailing procedures as they move toward the Sept. 23, 2013 HIPAA omnibus compliance date. Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point of Hudson, Fla. mistakenly sent out 10 different private patient records to Micki Thoms after she had requested her own records from the hospital. According to abcactionnews.com, the records contained information such as Social Security numbers.
 
 Beyond the disturbing trend of email or mailing errors among healthcare organizations, the way Bayonet Point reacted to Thoms’ efforts to contact the organization leave much to be desired. After not returning two phone calls, she called the CEO and returned the records on July 3. Soon after, the organization sent out data breach notification letters to the 10 patients.
 
 In an email to ABC, hospital spokesperson Kurt Conover responded. “Safe guarding patient privacy is among our top priorities. We have contacted the individuals involved to let them know we are investigating, and to offer appropriate protective measures to ensure their peace of mind.”
 
 Though Bayonet Point wasn’t forthcoming with plans to ensure human error such as this incident doesn’t happen again, maybe it will be with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Thoms has filed a complaint with HHS and it will be interesting to see how it views another errant patient record mailing.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,16.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Renown Health will be reviewing its policies covering the use of portable devices such as thumb drives and will be reeducating its workforce on safeguarding patient information.

 The compromised servers did not contain the medical records of all patients, only records of patients who received medical services between May 1, 2019 and June 12, 2019. The forensic investigation did not uncover any evidence to suggest patient information was viewed or copied and no reports have been received to suggest patient information has been misused.
 For the majority of affected patients, the breach was limited to names, dates of birth, and clinical information. A small subset of patients also had their Social Security number exposed.
 Patients whose Social Security number was exposed have been offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. RIENT is implementing additional technical safeguards to improve its security posture and prevent similar attacks in the future.

2015,Riverside County Regional Medical Center,CA,Theft,Laptop,"ABC News reports that an unencrypted laptop that went missing from Riverside County Regional Medical Center in December may have contained personal information of nearly 7,900 patients.
 
 At first blush, this new report appeared to be an update of a breach disclosure the center made in June, when they reported notifying 563 patients of a missing laptop that had been connected to electromyogram testing equipment. But it’s not – it’s a second breach that also involves a missing laptop.
 
 The following notice to patients, dated January 29, is prominently displayed on the center’s homepage:
 
 An unencrypted laptop computer reported missing from Riverside County Regional Medical Center (RCRMC) in December might have contained the personal information of patients who received ophthalmology and dermatology services at the hospital between Jan. 26, 2012 and last Nov. 26.
 
 RCRMC’s chief compliance officer, Jan Remm, said the hospital immediately notified law enforcement and began a thorough internal investigation after a department manager at the Moreno Valley-based hospital reported the laptop missing on Dec. 1.
 
 Remm said she has no reason to believe that the laptop was taken for its patient-related files or that information has been accessed or used in any way. She said computer forensic experts determined the information of approximately 7,900 patients might have been stored on the laptop. The information can include differing amounts of patient information, including names, addresses, birth dates and, in some instances, social security numbers and health plan policy numbers. Limited clinical information, such as diagnosis, also might have been present.
 
 “We are taking significant measures to safeguard patient privacy and to restrict unauthorized access to computers and devices that potentially contain patient data,” Remm said. “The privacy of our patients is a fundamental priority in our organization and part of our commitment to quality healthcare.”
 
 Remm said the hospital has significantly strengthened its inventory controls to prevent future loss of electronic devices, while cyber-security experts are currently encrypting all the organization’s computers and laptops to safeguard patient data. Letters are being mailed out to inform affected patients about the potential data breach, Remm said

 letters themselves contained only generic information about Dr. Jones’ retirement and included contact information
 for the department to schedule future appointments. If your letter was mailed to the wrong address, your name in the
 greeting/salutation portion of the letter would have been the only information identified by the mailing and there was
 no other specific information about you, such as your address, phone number, social security number, medical record
 number, or medical/treatment information contained in the letter. However, the letter would have identified you as
 a patient of Dr. Jones and therefore, we are providing you with this notification as required by law. Despite diligent
 efforts working with our vendor, we have been unable to identify the exact list of patients affected by this issue, so
 we are notifying all patients who may have been affected.
 Due to the fact that only your name would have been revealed if your letter was mailed to the wrong address, we
 believe that there is no risk of harm to you from this situation. Of course, you should always be diligent in protecting
 yourself by being cautious if anyone contacts you asking for personal information. For example, if you receive an
 unsolicited phone call regarding this letter, please let us know immediately. We emphasize, however, that your
 contact information was not included in any erroneous letter.

This investigation found that an unauthorized actor or actors had access to nine employees’ email accounts between November 2, 2018 and February 6, 2019.
 
 The investigation further determined that information pertaining to 72,224 patients was included in the email accounts that were affected. While Rutland Regional cannot confirm whether any specific information within the affected email accounts was actually accessed, viewed, or acquired without permission, the email accounts included among other things, data files that contain the types of demographic information that is used for health care billing such as patient names, contact information and medical record numbers. The information on the email accounts also contained 3,683 social security numbers.
 
 ""We take our responsibility to protect personal information very seriously,” said Claudio Fort, President and CEO of Rutland Regional. “Information privacy and security remain one of our highest priorities. We apologize for any inconvenience or concern this incident might have caused. We have taken and will continue to take steps to prevent something like this from happening again, including educating staff, reviewing technical controls and implementing additional safeguards and security measures to enhance the privacy and security of our patient information.”
 
 Rutland Regional has notified the media, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Vermont Attorney General’s Office. Rutland Regional is providing notice to potentially impacted individuals by way of a notification posted on the homepage of its website, https://www.rrmc.org/, as well as by publishing notice to certain state media outlets and in certain state media publications. Rutland Regional will be mailing notice letters to those individuals for whom Rutland Regional has confirmed mailing address information. Rutland Regional will also be offering credit monitoring as well as credit restoration services if necessary, to those patients whose social security numbers may have been accessed.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,96.0,72224.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2017,Rutland Regional Medical Center,VT,Unauthorized Disclosure,Email,"An electronic survey can provide healthcare organizations with valuable information to improve patient services; however, in the case of Rutland Regional Medical Center, it has resulted in a privacy breach.
 
 According to the Burlington Free Press, Rutland Regional Medical Center sent emails to more than 700 patients asking for opinions on discharge paperwork in an effort to make improvements to patient discharges.
 
 Rather than using an email group or the BCC field to mask patients email addresses, patients email addresses were added to the ‘to’ field. Consequently, the email addresses of more than 700 patients were revealed to all who received the mailshot.
 
 The error only revealed the email addresses of patients, many of whom would not have been easily identifiable from their email addresses. However, any patient who was identifiable from their email addresses would also have had their status as a patient of Rutland Regional Medical Center disclosed to other individuals. The email also suggests that the recipient had recently been discharged from hospital; something patients may have wished to remain private.
 
 Peg Bolgioni, a spokesperson for Rutland Regional Hospital, issued a statement apologizing for the error and privacy breach. She said as soon as staff were alerted to the mistake the mailing was terminated. An investigation into the incident has been launched to determine how the error was made.
 
 Errors such as this may not warrant HIPAA violation penalties and are unlikely to elevate the risk of patients experiencing identity theft and fraud, although there is potential for the disclosed email addresses to be misused.
 
 Email addresses can be used to send phishing emails and other malicious messages. For instance, malicious individuals could send phishing emails impersonating the hospital in an attempt to gather further information to commit fraud.
 
 Incidents such as this can all too easily occur as a result of poor training or human error. It is important for healthcare organizations to ensure that staff members are properly trained and policies and procedures implemented to prevent errors from resulting in patient privacy violations.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,665.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 No medical records were breached, but hackers gained access to patient names, dates of service, dates of birth, diagnoses and procedures, total charges and physician names. The social security numbers of 40 patients were also exposed. Notice — Breach of patient billing information
 Sacred Heart Health System, Inc.
 
 The privacy and security of patient information is of utmost importance to Sacred Heart Health System, Inc. and we have implemented significant security measures to protect such information. Regrettably, despite Sacred Heart’s efforts to safeguard patient information, a hacking attack has affected Sacred Heart patients.
 
 On February 2, 2015, we were notified by one of our third-party billing vendors that one of its employee’s e-mail user name and password had been compromised as a result of an e-mail hacking attack. The hacking attack was detected by our billing vendor on December 3, 2014 and the employee’s user name and password were shut down the same day. Upon notice of the incident, Sacred Heart, in cooperation with our billing vendor, immediately launched a thorough investigation into the matter. Sacred Heart engaged computer forensics experts who were able to conduct an analysis of what information was included in the affected e-mail account. After careful review, we were able to determine that the billing vendor’s employee e-mail account contained personal information for approximately 14,000 individuals.
 
 The personal health information in the e-mail account included patient names, date of service, date of birth, diagnosis and procedure, billing account numbers, total charges, and physician name. Approximately 40 individuals’, social security numbers were also compromised. The hackers did not gain access to individual medical records or billing records.
 
 Please be assured that Sacred Heart is taking steps to mitigate this incident by notifying affected individuals via letter, posting this substitute notice, and providing notice to prominent media outlets in the area. Identity monitoring and protection services are being offered free of charge for those whose social security number has been affected by the incident. Additionally, we are working with our e-mail service provider to evaluate ways to enhance our already robust security program. We will also provide additional education to employees regarding e-mail hacking attacks.
 
 In addition to the steps Sacred Heart has taken, affected individuals may wish to obtain a free credit report from each of the credit reporting bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. The credit bureaus’ information is below:

 Sacred Heart Health System in Florida has notified 532 patients about a potential PHI disclosure after a vendor was inadvertently granted access to patient data.
 
 The possible healthcare data breach occurred at the American College of Cardiology. Sacred Heart contributes data on cardiovascular patients and procedures to a national registry at the non-profit medical society.
 
 American College of Cardiology was working with a software developer to redesign its registry when it accidently included a table of patient data for testing purposes.
 
 The table contained names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and internal patient identification numbers.
 
 Sacred Heart was notified on February 16 that some of its patient data may have been accessed by an American College of Cardiology software developer.
 
 “When ACC discovered this issue, it immediately terminated the vendor's access to the patient data,” explained Sacred Heart’s statement. “The ACC also obtained a written attestation from its vendor that the patient data has been destroyed and that the vendor did not retain copies. The software developer has also attested that its staff used the data only for purposes of their work for ACC.”
 
 Sacred Heart contacted affected individuals and urged them to review their credit reports for potential misuse of their personal information.

One email account was compromised in the attack; however that user had privileges to access Protected Health Information (PHI) and the account contained the records of approximately 25,000 patients of the facility.
 
 Out of the 24,967 records exposed, only four contained Social Security numbers but a considerable amount of data was potentially obtained by the person responsible for the attack. The data included patient names, gender, dates of birth, medical record numbers and health insurance information and a limited amount of clinical data.
 
 It is not clear from the notice when the incident occurred, although it was posted on the company website on April 27, 2015 and the incident was reported to the Office for Civil Rights on April 24, 2015.
 
 The email account that was compromised was immediately closed as soon as the intrusion was detected and the healthcare provider has been on high alert since. No further threat is believed to remain of further records being compromised, although the hacker responsible for the attack may have been able to copy the PHI of the affected patients.
 
 A computer forensics investigation was conducted to determine the extent of the breach and the patients affected. St. Agnes is now taking steps to ensure that a similar breach will not occur in the future.
 
 Sharon McNamara is the Corporate Responsibility Officer at Saint Agnes Healthcare, Inc. She issued a statement which was posted on the St. Agnes website in which she said “we reported the incident to our e-mail service provider and are evaluating additional ways to enhance our already robust security program,” she also said “we will continue to implement administrative, technical and physical safeguards against unauthorized access of protected health information.”
 
 When Social Security numbers are obtained by criminals the risk of fraud is significantly increased. Because of this, Saint Agnes Health Care will be offering credit monitoring services to the individuals whose Social Security numbers were present in the data.
 
 All affected St. Agnes patients have been sent breach notification letters and have been advised to obtain a free credit report from TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. They should also monitor their credit statements closely

2016,Saint Agnes Medical Center,CA,HACK,Other,"Saint Agnes Medical Center of Fresno, CA., is in the process of notifying 2,812 employees of a cyberattack that occurred on May 2, 2016.
 
 On Monday this week, an employee of Saint Agnes responded to a phishing email and sent copies of employees’ W-2 data to an attacker. The disclosed data included the names of employees along with their home addresses, salary details, withholding information, and Social Security numbers. The email request appeared to have come from the Chief Executive Office of Saint Agnes. The phishing attack was rapidly identified, although not before data were disclosed to the attacker.
 
 All employees affected by the data breach have been provided with a year of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian without charge. Affected employees have also been advised to contact the IRS to find out if a fraudulent tax refund has been claimed in their name.
 
 The email scam is referred to as a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack. This year has seen a number of BEC attacks on healthcare providers. The phishing scam is convincing as the emails appear to come from within the organization. The email account of a senior executive is compromised and an email sent by the attacker from that individuals account, or a similar domain is purchased that closely resembles that of the target company. Oftentimes the spoofed domain contains two transposed letters. At a casual glance the email appears genuine.
 
 BEC attacks are often successful because employees do not want to refuse requests from the CEO or other senior executives, and do not want to bother those individuals with a phone call to verify the genuineness of the request.
 
 In contrast to the majority of HIPAA-covered entities that delay the announcement of a data breach, Saint Agnes Medical Center acted swiftly and decisively to reduce the risk of employees coming to harm as a result of the cyberattack. Just two days after the attack occurred the healthcare provider notified employees via email. The Office of the Attorney General and other agencies were also informed. The FBI was alerted to the BEC attack and is now investigating, Employees should also receive a letter in the mail in the next few days.
 
 Rapid notification of a BEC attack is important. Victims of BEC attacks face a high risk of identity theft and tax fraud. The stolen data are used by attackers to file false tax returns in the names of the victims. Fast action can reduce the risk of harm being caused.
 
 Salted Hash has been keeping tabs on BEC attacks this year. During the first quarter of 2016, 41 organizations in the United States had reported suffering BEC attacks. Other healthcare organizations that have been targeted with BEC attacks this year include Main Line Health, York Hospital, eClinicalWorks, CareCentrix, Endologix Inc., and Magnolia Health Corporation. On March 1, 2016., the IRS issued an alert due to the rapid rise in BEC attacks.
 
 Unfortunately, this type of cyberattack is difficult to block. The best defense against such attacks is to conduct awareness training and to implement procedures to ensure that any request for tax data of employees is verified before an email is sent.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2.0,2812.0,281200.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2012,"Saint Mary's Hospital, Naugatuck Valley Community College",CT,DISC,Other,"State, feds investigate leak of patient information at Saint Mary’s Hospital
 BY MICHAEL PUFFER REPUBLICAN-AMERICAN
 WATERBURY — State and federal health agencies are investigating a leak of patient information from Saint Mary’s Hospital that occurred when an Naugatuck Valley Community College instructor used X-rays and medical images in the classroom.
 
 That the images were used to train students is not a problem. The issue was that some of the images included patient names, according to hospital staff.
 
 The instructor, Tony Santos, continues to work as an NVCC faculty member and also works part-time in the radiology department of Saint Mary’s Hospital.
 
 The leak is a violation of the federal health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), but appears entirely unintentional, said Dr. Steve Holland, chief medical officer for Saint Mary’s Hospital.
 
 Santos has an otherwise “very good” work history and it appears he tried, unsuccessfully, to redact identifying patient information from the images shared with students, Holland said.
 
 
 The hospital learned of the issue in December, after an NVCC student sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Holland confirmed.
 
 News of the breach broke Sunday in the online blog ctwatchdog.com.
 
 The Connecticut Department of Public Health launched an investigation Monday based on “news reports,” spokesman William Gerrish said. He said he could answer no further questions on the ongoing investigation.
 
 The hospital has since closed off NVCC access to patient medical images and scoured its systems to confirm there were no further leaks, Holland said. He was unable to say exactly how many patients had their information inappropriately disclosed, or over what period of time.
 
  Mrs. Waltraud B. Louis
 The hospital has taken steps to better secure its data as part of an action plan submitted to the federal agency, staff say. Santos has also received additional training on patient privacy , Holland said.
 
 “I think people should rest assured that Saint Mary’s is doing everything we can,” Holland said.
 
 NVCC Dean of Administration James Troup said the college has conducted its own investigation. He said he couldn’t talk about the conclusions of that investigation or the resulting actions taken by the college until the federal investigation is complete.
 
 “We believe we have a handle on the situation,” Troup said.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center sent warning letters this month to about 128,000 patients and clients after a possible intrusion into a proprietary databases. Advertisement
 
 The database, used for Saint Mary's health education classes and wellness programs, contained personal information such as names and addresses, limited health information and some Social Security numbers. The database did not contain medical records or credit card information, said Gary Aldax, marketing manager for Saint Mary's.
 
 ""What happened was that an unauthorized person may have accessed the database,"" Aldax said. ""We're currently working with Equifax, which is one of the three major credit agencies, to help handle this for us.
 
 ""In some cases, there were people who had their Social Security numbers (in the database) as well, so we're sending different letters to people depending on their situation.""
 
 The potential breach was discovered in April 28. Saint Mary's officials said they immediately shut down the database and launched an investigation. The delay in notifications occurred because the database had to be reconstructed, Aldax said.
 
 Investigators have found no evidence that identity theft or fraud has occurred, he said. But since they cannot be certain, letters were sent informing clients and patients who might be affected by a breach.
 
 Eighty-year-old Wilma Sheldon of Reno thought the letter she received -- dated July 15 -- was a scam when she first read it. Sheldon said she became especially suspicious after she found out her daughter got a letter, too.
 
 The last time her daughter had anything to do with Saint Mary's occurred when she got her tonsils removed about 40 years ago, Sheldon said. The letter has Sheldon seething.
 
 ""I threw (the letter) in the waste basket, but then I started to think about it,"" Sheldon said. ""Now I'm just really mad. We're supposed to have this privacy act and all, and that sure sounds like a bunch of baloney now. I think it's awful.""
 
 To allay fears, Saint Mary's is offering free credit monitoring for one year to people whose Social Security numbers were in the database. Other patients and clients can place a fraud alert on their accounts at no charge.
 
 To prevent another potential breach, safeguards have been added to the database, said Mike Uboldi, Saint Mary's president and chief executive officer in a news release.

2017,Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital,TN,Improper Disposal,Paper/Films,"This month, North Dakota Department of Human Services and Texas Health and Human Services have both reported that patients’ protected health information has been disposed of improperly. Today, another HIPAA-covered entity – Saint Thomas Rutherford Hospital in Murfreesboro, TN – has reported a similar incident.
 
 Documents containing the protected health information of almost 3,000 patients were discovered to have been abandoned by the side of a remote, rural road in DeKalb County in April. The documents were discovered by a member of the public.
 
 Upon being notified of the discarded reports, St Thomas Rutherford Hospital immediately launched an investigation but it is currently unclear how the documents were discarded and who was responsible.
 
 The documents were reports on a sample of 2,859 patient census reports and date between 2009 and 2010. Affected patients have now been notified of the privacy breach by mail and the incident has been reported to all appropriate authorities.
 
 The documents contained no medical records or Social Security numbers, only each patient’s name, admitting diagnosis, date of birth, physician’s name and account number. Due to the limited nature of data in the documents, Saint Thomas Rutherford hospital does not believe patients face any additional financial risk as a result of the breach.
 
 Cynthia Figaro, Corporate Responsibility Officer and Corporate Privacy Officer of Saint Thomas Health issued a statement about the incident in which she confirmed, “Protecting the privacy of our patient’s information is always a top priority for us at Saint Thomas Health and Ascension,” and sincerely apologized to patients for the privacy violation.
 
 The investigation confirmed that no further disclosures of patient information have occurred and a third-party firm has been contracted to ensure all storage files are appropriately secured until they can be permanently destroyed in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Rules.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1.0,2859.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2011,Saints Medical Center,MA,PHYS,Other,"The Kentucky-based 6-hospital health system Med Center Health has reported a data breach affecting approximately 160,000 patients. Med Center Health believes a former employee may have stolen patients’ protected health information (PHI) prior to leaving employment.
 
 The former employee has been accused of stealing PHI including names, addresses, health insurance information, Social Security numbers, procedure codes and billing information. Medical records were not compromised at any point.
 
 The FBI has been notified and is also investigating along with other federal agencies. Med Center health is in the process of notifying patients of the breach, although the process is expected to take a couple of weeks due to the number of individuals that have been impacted.
 
 While the breach has only recently been announced, the data theft incidents date back to 2014 and 2015. The former employee is understood to have taken an encrypted CD and encrypted portable storage device in August 2014 and February 2015. There was no legitimate work reason for ePHI to have been taken, although on both occasions the former employee claimed the data were needed for word-related duties.
 
 The Bowling Green Daily News suggests Med Center Health discovered the breach several months ago, although notifications were delayed. A spokesperson for Med Center Health told Bowling Green Daily News “Med Center Health informed patients as expeditiously as possible. It is important to understand that the information leading Med Center Health to report the incident pursuant to HIPAA developed over time during an intensive internal investigation.”
 
 Patients affected by the breach had received medical services at one of six Med Center Health facilities between 2011 and 2014: Cal Turner Rehab and Specialty Care, Medical Center EMS, the Commonwealth Regional Specialty Hospital, the Medical Center at Bowling Green, the Medical Center at Franklin and the Medical Center at Scottsville.
 
 Patients impacted by the breach have been offered 12 months of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services without charge. Med Center Health has not uncovered any evidence to suggest that any of the stolen information was used to commit fraud, although the possibility cannot be ruled out.",0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,210.0,1000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2014,"Salina Healthcare Center, Salina Health Education",KS,DISC,Other,"The Salina Health Education Foundation, doing business as the Salina Family Healthcare Center, has caused a breach of 9,640 patient records after a member of staff submitted a database to the National Commission for Quality Assurance as part of a care coordination research study. The database was sent via email, and since the medium is insecure and the data was not encrypted, this potentially could lead to PHI falling into the hands of individuals unauthorized to view the information.
 
 According to a statement released by the medical center in response to the breach, the incident occurred on April 8, 2014. The data that was exposed contained sensitive information which could potentially be used to commit fraud, although no Social Security numbers or financial information was present in the database.
 
 Information included patient names and dates of birth, chart numbers and medical codes, which should have been removed prior to the data being sent. The lack of data de-identification was immediately spotted by NCQA staff, which alerted the medical center and immediately deleted the database. It is unlikely that the data was intercepted and the risk to patients is understood to be very low.
 
 The incident has been reported to the Office for Civil Rights, as required by the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, although it is not clear if breach notification letters have been sent to affected individuals, as required by the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.
 
 HIPAA demands that a covered entity takes action immediately following the discovery of the breach to mitigate any damage caused, in addition to taking action to prevent future breaches from occurring. The Salina Family Healthcare Center was able to confirm that the database had been deleted, so no further risk remains, and it has embarked on a program of training to ensure that all members of staff are fully aware of the requirements of HIPAA. The member of staff responsible for the breach has also been disciplined.
 
 It may not be possible to eliminate human error, but covered entities can reduce the risk of accidental disclosure of Protected Health Information by ensuring that all members of staff are made aware of the rules and regulations covering the use, access and disclosure of Protected Health Information. All covered entities must provide full training to staff and should also conduct refresher training sessions periodically.
 
 Since the OCR may choose to investigate organizations following data breaches – and via its audit program – it is essential that all training is documented. Members of staff receiving training must sign a document to say that the training has been provided, and these records must be stored securely and made available to auditors and investigators.
 
 Regardless of the amount of training provided to the staff, if a covered entity cannot prove that training has been provided and received, it will constitute a violation of HIPAA and the CE could potentially receive a financial penalty for non-compliance.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,9640.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2007,Salina Regional Health Center,KS,PORT,Other,"A laptop computer containing the names, social security numbers and medical history of up to 1,100 patients is missing, putting them at risk for identity theft, and Salina Regional Health Center officials are offering a $2,000 reward for the laptop's return.
 
 The hospital's computer was stolen along with a docking station, printer, overhead projector and other computer equipment, plus a small amount of prescription drugs, from the office of Veridian Behavioral Health, 501 S. Santa Fe., Suite 300, earlier this month.
 
 Last week, those patients whose privacy was potentially compromised received letters from the hospital, notifying them to let their financial institutions know about the threat and to be on guard for false charges, Beth Vinson, the hospital's marketing supervisor, said Sunday.
 
 Vinson wouldn't identify the laptop's authorized user for concern that publicly identifying him could further compromise patient privacy.
 
 Manage Your Credit with Equifax
 
 The reason the patient information was stored on the machine was because the user travels to different offices to treat patients. (iQBio Commentary - Visiting Nurses or Traveling Doctors are REQUIRED to have Encrypted Data on their Laptops and secure access with a high encryption password or biometrics according to the DSHS Standards. Why was this not done? This is a violation of a FEDERAL LAW - One that is almost never enforced)
 
 ""This person has different offices to go to, and this way when he traveled to different offices, he'd have that information available to him,"" Vinson said.
 
 Vinson stressed that only patients treated by the laptop user would be at risk of having their identities stolen. At the time of the theft, the computer was shut off, and the patient information is double password protected (iQBio Commentary - most passwords are simple passwords - was this a ""secure password or two simple unsecure passwords?) , she said.
 
 ""At this point, there's no information that any of the information has been breached,"" Vinson said.
 
 Salina Police Department officials said Sunday that none of the missing property has been recovered, and there have been no arrests made in connection with the case.
 
 Anyone with any information on the theft may call Salina police at 826-7210, or Crimestoppers at 825-TIPS.
 
 The hospital has given those individuals potentially affected a phone number to call to speak with the hospital's privacy officer, Donna Vineyard, about any concerns. Vineyard directs the hospital's information management department, where medical records are stored.
 
 ""We've received about 15 calls. No one has had any problems yet,"" Vinson said. ""But we wanted to make sure that every possible method was used, so no one is the victim of identity theft.""
 
 In the meantime, she said, the hospital's security policies on the use of laptop computers are being reviewed.
 
 There have been laptop thefts from government offices and private companies nationwide in several high-profile cases in recent years. In December, for instance, Boeing officials reported a laptop stolen containing the names and Social Security numbers of 382,000 workers and retirees. The laptop was stolen when an employee left it unattended.
 
 ""As small as computer hard drives are now, anyone could take a hard drive and walk out of any office,"" Vinson said. ""It's going to be a problem as long as technology improves and devices get smaller.
 
 ""We do regret it happened. We're just trying to do everything possible to make sure we find the laptop and deal with those responsible.""

2013,Samaritan Hospital (via Rensselaer County Jail),NY,INSD,Other,"TROY -- An official at Samaritan Hospital confirmed a nursing supervisor at the Rensselaer County jail improperly accessed the hospital's patient records, triggering an investigation by Sheriff Jack Mahar. Elmer Streeter, director of communications at St. Peter's Health Partners, the corporate parent of Samaritan, said the hospital was notified of the breach in November 2011. ""We received an inquiry that suggested that protected health information contained in electronic medical records that related to a patient at Samaritan Hospital may have been improperly accessed by a supervisory nursing staff member employed at the Rensselaer County Jail,"" he said. Samaritan officials conducted an internal investigation after receiving the notification. ""We determined that there had been improper access on a particular account,"" Streeter said. The hospital notified the sheriff about the breach and disabled the access of the individual whom they believed improperly accessing the information. Streeter said the hospital's next step would have been to follow federal guidelines and notify patients whose records were improperly accessed. But a sheriff's investigation into the matter prevented them from doing so. ""The sheriff asked the hospital not to notify these persons,"" Streeter said. ""We're required to do that by federal regulations; if a law enforcement agency asks to delay notification so as not to impede an investigation of a potentially criminal nature, we have to comply."" At this point, some 14 months later, the sheriff's office has authorized Samaritan Hospital to notify the patients. Streeter said letters were being sent this week. Asked the identity of the employee who committed the breach and why, Yvonne Keefe, a spokeswoman for Mahar, said: ""The sheriff's office is investigating a complaint filed by Samaritan Hospital regarding medical records. This office has no comment on internal investigations or personnel matters."" Because Samaritan Hospital provides treatment for inmates, the jail's nursing staff has access to Samaritan's electronic medical records for the purposes of coordinating care. Streeter said persons granted access sign an agreement stating they would only access records for patients to whom they are providing care. ""The issue here is that some individuals used poor judgment and did not follow applicable privacy laws and standards of ethical conduct,"" Streeter said. It was unclear what penalties apply to breaches of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations. According to the Office for Civil Rights, charged with enforcing HIPPA regulations nationwide, a breach is defined as ""an impermissible use or disclosure that compromises the security or privacy of the protected health information such that the use or disclosure poses a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the affected individual."" After a notification of a breach is received by the Office of Civil Rights, the complaint is reviewed internally. Depending on a number of factors, the breach complaint can be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for a criminal investigation. Streeter said Samaritan did not notify the Office of Civil Rights of the breach, citing advice from their legal department. Penalties could range from formal findings of fact to criminal prosecution.

2018,San Mateo Medical Center,CA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"San Mateo Medical Center notifies patients after records erroneously recycled instead of shredded
 DECEMBER 1, 2018DISSENT
 Updated Feb. 22, 2019. DataBreaches.net was notified that HHS had finally removed the disputed listing from their portal. But when I checked, I found that it had not really been removed. OCR had closed its case and moved the entry to its archived list, with the following note:
 
 On November 13, 2018, OCR received a breach notification report from San Mateo Medical Center (SMMC). SMMC reported that the breach affected approximately 5,000 individuals. After an internal investigation, SMMC determined that the report was filed in error, the incident did not amount to a breach and, the incident should not have been reported since no breach occurred. Based on this information, OCR closed the case.
 Under the circumstances, it’s not clear why HHS didn’t just delete the entry entirely.
 Previous Update: Note: Following publication of this story, DataBreaches.net was contacted by an SMMC employee who was very upset at what he claimed was inaccurate reporting by this site. He suggested that I do a “sanity-check” on reporting and was upset that I had reported that 5,000 patients were notified. I pointed out to him that the 5,000 figure came from HHS’s public breach tool. He backed off a bit and said he would investigate as that had not been reported to HHS. I never heard back from him or anyone else. As of Dec. 7, the 5,000 figure is still on HHS’s breach tool. So is the correct number 500 or 5000 or something else? At this point, DataBreaches.net is really not sure.
 The San Mateo Medical Center has notified 5,000 patients at its Daly City Medical Center location of a breach.
 
 A November 30 notice on its web site explains that SMMC became aware on November 7, 2018 that on November 6, a
 
 staff person at the Daly City Clinic left a box containing patient information under her desk overnight. The temporary housekeeping staff mistook the box for recycling and put the documents in the recycling bin and not the confidential bin for shredding.
 
 SMMC was unable to determine whose records were in the bin, and so wound up notifying 5,000 patients.
 
 In response to the incident, SMMC reinforced their policies about records to be shredded and eliminated the use of recycling bins altogether:
 
 We regret that this incident occurred, and are reinforcing our policy that medical staff should place all documents with patient information in the confidential bin for shredding and not leave documents with patient information out overnight. A clinic site visit was conducted on November 8, 2018 and November 16, 2018. The clinic manager for Daly City instructed that recycling bins no longer be used and confidential information be immediately placed in a confidential shred bin.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1.0,5000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 A computer ""thumb drive"" with information on X-ray patients went missing after a June 2 burglary at an outpatient imaging center at 121 Sotoyome Dr., located across the street from Memorial, officials said.
 
 The following day, hospital officials learned the drive was missing from the locker of a staff member who had backed up X-ray records on the drive in preparation for a data migration to Santa Rosa Memorial's electronic medical records system.
 
 The drive contained references to 33,702 patients who received services at the site from Feb. 2, 2009, through May 13, 2014. That information included the patient's first and last names, gender, medical record number, date of birth, date and time of service, area of the body imaged, the X-ray technologist's name and the radiation level required to produce the X-ray, in compliance with patient-safety standards.
 
 The information did not include Social Security numbers, financial information, insurance data or diagnoses, officials said.
 
 ""We take our obligation to protect patients' privacy very seriously, and apologize for any concerns or inconvenience to patients and their families that this causes,"" said Todd Salnas, president of St. Joseph Health in Sonoma County, which owns and operates Santa Rosa Memorial. ""Following this burglary, we immediately heightened security measures and training at our new Sotoyome Drive facility, and are committed to preventing such an intrusion from happening again.""
 
 Santa Rosa Memorial said it is mailing personal letters this week to each of the patients affected by this potential breach, and on June 9, reported the incident to the California Department of Public Health.
 
 The hospital said it has no indication that any of the patients' information has been used in any unauthorized or improper manner. Yet as a precaution and courtesy, it is offering credit-monitoring and identity-theft-protection services to affected patients at no cost for one year.
 
 An internal hospital investigation and concurrent investigation by Santa Rosa Police began after employees discovered the burglary June 2. Efforts to recover the missing drive continue.
 
 This is the second data breach St. Joseph Health has experienced in the past two years. In 2012, the health system alerted 31,800 patients across the state of a data breach including some 10,000 patients in Santa Rosa, Petaluma and Napa. St. Joseph Health acquired Redwood Regional Medical Group in April.

2014,Self Regional Healthcare Medical Center,SC,Theft,Laptop,"Self Regional Healthcare (SRH), a healthcare provider based in South Carolina, has announced that a laptop computer was stolen from one of its facilities on May 25, 2014. That laptop contained unencrypted Protected Health Information of nearly 40,000 of its patients.
 The data included highly sensitive information which could potentially be used by criminals to commit identity fraud, insurance fraud, credit card fraud and enable them to make false Medicaid/Medicare claims. Social Security numbers; drivers license numbers; financial account numbers; physician names; payment card information; insurance policy details; diagnosis and procedure information and patient names – possibly addresses – were stored on the laptop.
 SRH learned of the break-in and theft on May 27, 2014. Law enforcement officers were alerted and were able to apprehend two individuals believed to have illegally entered the property. One person admitted to stealing the laptop, but according to the report “he destroyed it and disposed of it in a lake,” after an attack of remorse. He also claimed not to have accessed the contents of the laptop – which were password protected. Law enforcement divers were unable to locate the device.
 As a result of the breach, SRH is offering all affected individuals one year of credit monitoring services free of charge. Breach notification letters have now been sent to all patients affected by the breach.
 According to the breach reporting portal of the HHS’ Office for Civil Rights, the laptop computer contained 38,906 patient records. This makes this incident similar in scale to the Union Labor Life Insurance Company data breach reported in June. That data breach was also due to a stolen laptop computer containing unencrypted PHI.
 In June, there were six breaches of PHI affecting more than 500 individuals caused by the theft of laptops and desktop computers. In May of this year, Sutherland Healthcare Solutions announced a data breach that created 342,197 victims.
 Data encryption is not mandatory under HIPAA regulations, but healthcare organizations should consider the cost implications of not using this protection.

 The laptop held information about Shands patients and individuals who were referred over the past three years to the Shands at the University of Florida gastroenterology clinical services department, referred to as the G.I. Clinical Services department. Personal information stored on the laptop may include names, addresses, physician name, medical record numbers and abbreviated medical procedure or condition codes. The laptop also contained the Social Security numbers of about 650 people.
 
 Shands has no evidence to believe that any of the confidential information stored on the computer has been used for fraudulent purposes. However, as a precaution, Shands officials have worked to quickly notify the people whose information was on the computer. Letters have gone out this week providing information and instructions about taking additional protective steps. Shands has also posted a notice on its public Web site Shands.org and has alerted statewide media per state and federal guidelines.
 
 “We very much regret that this happened,” said Shands HealthCare CEO Timothy Goldfarb. “We’re doing all we can to work with and support those affected. We’re also working to reinforce our privacy policies and practices within the organization.”
 
 A Shands employee had downloaded the health information onto an unencrypted Shands-owned laptop at home for work-related purposes. The employee reported the computer stolen on Jan. 27 when the employee’s home was burglarized. The Gainesville Police Department was notified immediately and initiated an investigation into the theft. Shands also immediately launched an internal investigation. The Shands HealthCare Privacy Office has reported this incident in compliance with state and federal regulations.
 
 Shands leaders have since launched a systemwide encryption initiative to better safeguard protected health information stored on Shands-owned computers, laptops and other portable communications devices as well as on employee-owned devices used to support Shands work.

2017,Silver Cross Hospital,IL,Unauthorized Disclosure,Network Server,"Silver Cross Hospital in New Lenox, IL, has learned that the protected health information of 8,862 patients has been exposed as a result of a software update performed by a business associate that manages certain parts of its website.
 
 The software upgrade was performed on the website in November 2016, which resulted in security settings being inadvertently reconfigured. As a result, information entered by patients in webforms was made available over the Internet and could potentially have been accessed by unauthorized individuals. Silver Cross Hospital said change to the security settings was discovered internally on June 14, 2017. The vendor was immediately contacted and the site was rapidly secured.
 
 A computer forensics firm was contracted to perform an analysis of the website to establish whether any of the exposed information had been accessed by unauthorized individuals during the seven months that data were accessible. The investigation did not uncover any evidence to suggest unauthorized individuals navigated to the forms and viewed patient health information, although the possibility could not be ruled out.
 
 At no point did the security incident affect the hospital’s electronic health record system or any data stored by the hospital. The only information that could potentially be viewed was information entered via the forms and stored by its vendor.
 
 The breach affects patients who used a range of forms on the website. Those forms collected a range of sensitive information including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, IP addresses and patients’ marital status. Some patients also had their Social Security number, insurance details and some health information exposed, but only if that information had been submitted via the webforms. While the software update occurred in late November, the breach impacts patients who used the webforms between January 2013 and June 14, 2017. In some cases, patients and payment guarantors may have had their information entered into the webforms by a third party and may therefore not be aware that they have been impacted by the incident.
 
 Silver Cross Hospital has now notified all impacted individuals for whom valid contact addresses are held. All individuals affected by the breach have been offered complimentary credit monitoring services for 12 months.
 
 Steps have also been taken to improve security and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. Those measures include reviewing and updating policies and procedures related to website security, the provision of additional training for staff members, and a detailed assessment of security practices by experts in the field.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,255.0,8862.0,886200.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Potentially-compromised data includes patient names, dates of service, procedures, surgeons, hospital charges and names of insurance companies. Social Security numbers, birth dates, driver’s licenses and addresses were not exposed, according to news.sonomaportal.com.

2013,South Florida State Hospital,FL,INSD,Other,"A Florida hospital experienced a data breach courtesy of an employee whose job was to help patients with mental health problems find jobs within the hospital system.
According to the Sun-Sentinal, Curtis Fullwood, 57, and his cousin, Terri Davis, 45, have pleaded not guilty to a federal indictment charging them with conspiracy to commit identity theft, conspiring to disclose individual's health information, access device fraud, wrongful disclosure of health information and aggravated identity theft. Fullwood was an employee at South Florida State Hospital in Pembroke Pines.
The two are accused of working together to steal individual patients' names and social security numbers to file fraudulent income tax returns between September and April of 2012, investigators said.
Fullwood obtained patients' information by illegally using computers at the Pembroke Pines psychiatric hospital to steal the identities of people who were admitted for treatment, according to court records. The two suspects had identifying information for more than 1,000 people without their permission, FBI agents wrote.
Davis and Fullwood came under suspicion when Davis turned over some of the patients' identities to an informant who was working under cover with the FBI, agents wrote. The meeting was secretly recorded, records show.
Workers for GEO Care, which runs the facility, checked their computer records and found that Fullwood was the only employee who viewed patient admissions reports on their computers on the dates in question, according to the Sun-Sentinal.",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,1000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
2013,South Miami Hospital,FL,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"A South Florida hospital worker who stole more than 800 patients' Social Security numbers and sold them to a multimillion-dollar tax fraud ring, pleaded guilty her role in the conspiracy.
Betty Cole, 34, of Miami, faces a maximum of seven years in federal prison.
Federal prosecutors promised her they will recommend that she get a lighter punishment because she cooperated in the investigation and testified in trial against the Fort Lauderdale ringleader of the group, Alci Bonannee.
Bonannee, 36, is now serving more than 26 years in federal prison for masterminding the identity theft ring. 
Bonannee's methods were so successful that she and her codefendants submitted $11.7 million worth of fraudulent income tax refunds, and the IRS approved some $4.5 million of those refunds, according to court records.
Cole, who worked as a respiratory therapist for South Miami Hospital, admitted Monday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale that she stole the names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers of more than 800 patients between June 2011 and February 2012.
Cole ""prepared a handwritten list"" of patients' personal identifying information that she had access to in the course of doing her job, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Berger told the judge in court Monday. She prepared lists on a number of occasions after Bonannee asked Cole to get the information, Cole admitted.
""Cole knew that Bonannee would use the personal identity information to submit fraudulent tax returns [and] Bonannee paid Cole thousands of dollars for … [more than] 800 patients' information,"" according to the plea agreement.
In a statement released shortly after the breach of patient information was discovered, Baptist Health, which operates South Miami Hospital, said that Cole had been terminated.

Several federal investigative agencies have issued reminders to patients that it may not be necessary to give a Social Security number to medical providers unless that is the only way the insurance provider can distinguish them from other clients. But medical providers may need the Social Security number to verify insurance coverage if that is how they distinguish between accounts.

Cole,pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to possess unauthorized access devices — the patients' Social Security numbers. She was released on a $100,000 bond pending sentencing on Sept. 23, 2013.

Two other codefendants Sonyini Clay, 40, of Miami Gardens, and Chante Mozley, 34, are both serving prison terms. Clay was sentenced to more than 10 years in federal prison and Mozley is serving 3 1/2 years",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,834.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
2010,South Shore Hospital (via Active Data Solutions),MA,PORT,Other,"South Shore Hospital, located in South Weymouth, Mass., posted notification of the data breach on its website earlier this week. The hospital, which is in the process of personally notifying affected individuals via conventional mail, said the incident occurred this past February when it sent outdated data files to a professional data management company to have them destroyed.

A lengthy list of those affected includes patients, employees, donors, volunteers, vendors, and other partners – up to 800 000 in all, from January 1996 through January of this year. A host of personal information was contained on the files, from driver’s license numbers, SSNs, medical records, and even banking details for what South Shore said is “a small subset”.

In February of 2010, the hospital contracted with a Pennsylvania company, Archive Data Solutions, to erase and re-sell 473 data tapes containing information on 800,000 individuals,"" writes The Boston Globe's Hiawatha Bray. ""None of the data was encrypted, and so it could be read by anyone with the right equipment and training. The hospital did not inform Archive Data that the tapes contained sensitive information. The tapes were shipped to a Texas subcontractor in three boxes, but the hospital later learned that only one of the boxes arrived.""
The Attorney General said the hospital not only failed to notify Archive Data Solutions of the sensitive information stored on the files but did not establish if the contractor had the proper security measures in place to protect the information, violating U.S. legislation,"" writes iTnews' Marcos Colon.

""All available evidence indicated that the back-up computer files were most likely disposed of in a secure commercial landfill and were therefore unrecoverable,"" the hospital said in a statement. ""In the two years since the back-up computer files were reported as missing, there remains no evidence that any information on the files has ever been accessed or used by anyone.""

OC, Inc., a provider of billing services, discovered an unauthorized individual had gained access to an email account of one of its employees. The email account was discovered to contain the PHI of approximately 1,100 Spectrum Health Lakeland patients.

OS Inc. discovered a potential breach on December 21, 2018 after suspicious activity was detected within an employee email account. A third-party computer forensics expert was hired to assist with the investigation and found no evidence to suggest that any PHI in emails and attachments had been accessed or stolen. However, it was not possible to rule out data access or exfiltration with a sufficiently high level of certainty.
Consequently, the breach was determined to be a reportable incident and notifications to patients were warranted. The email account contained a limited amount of patient information such as names, addresses, health services provided, dates of service, diagnoses, and the names of health insurance providers.
Spectrum Health Lakeland was notified about the breach on March 8, 2019 and has been working with technology experts to determine the full extent and nature of the breach. Spectrum Health Lakeland will continue to use the business associate and has been working closely with the company to ensure additional protections are implemented to prevent any further breaches.

Parents or guardians of the affected patients have been mailed a letter explaining the situation.
The pictures included patients’ names, dates of birth, dates of service and medical record numbers.

Pictures did not include patients’ Social Security Numbers or any other sensitive financial information, such as health plans or insurance card numbers.

2017,SSM Health,MO,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"The St. Louis, MO-based not-for-profit health system SSM Health has discovered a former employee has been accessing the health records of patients without any legitimate work reason for doing so for 8 months.

The former employee worked in SSM Health’s customer service call center, and as such, did not have access to financial information, only demographic, health, and clinical information.

The improper access was detected by SSM health on October 30, prompting a thorough investigation to determine the records that had been accessed and which patients were potentially at risk. The investigation revealed the records of patients in multiple states were accessed by the employee between February 13 and October 20, 2017.

The employee was primarily interested in the records of patients of a primary care physician in the St. Louis area, specifically patients who had been prescribed a controlled substance. While that subset of patients was relatively small, it was not possible to determine the full scope of the privacy breach, so SSM Health took the decision to notify all patients whose records had been accessed by the former employee. In many cases, that access will have been for legitimate work purposes.

In total, 29,000 patients have been notified of the incident and warned that their protected health information may have been improperly accessed and could potentially have been misused. Those patients have been offered identity theft protection services without charge.

SSM Health has also changed its procedures to require an additional identifier to be used when patients request prescription refills via its call center. Internal policies and procedures have been reviewed and employee access monitoring tools have been strengthened to ensure any future illegal employee activity is identified more rapidly.

The incident has been reported to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights and law enforcement has been notified.

SSM Health privacy officer, Scott Didion, said, “We take very seriously our role of safeguarding our patients’ personal information, and we deeply regret any inconvenience or concern this situation may have caused our patients.”

In a statement released on December 29, 2017, SSM Health said the employee accessed protected health information of patients across several states, including demographic and other types of clinical information, which constitutes a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,29579.0,2957900.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2018,SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital - Jefferson City,MO,Improper Disposal,Paper/Films,"SSM Health St. Mary’s Hospital in Jefferson City, Missouri is informing hundreds of thousands of patients that some of their protected health information has been left unprotected and could potentially have been viewed by unauthorized individuals.

On November 16, 2014, St. Mary’s Hospital moved to new premises and all patients’ medical records were transferred to the new facility and were secured at all times. However, on June 1, 2018, the hospital discovered many documents containing protected health information had been left behind.

The documents were mostly administrative and operational supporting documents and contained only a limited amount of protected health information. For the majority of patients, the only information that was exposed was their name and medical record number. Some patients also had some clinical data, demographic information, and financial information exposed.

Due to the number of documents involved, the hospital has retained a document services firm to catalogue all the documents and determine which patients have had some of their PHI exposed. It has taken some time for that process to be completed and for St. Mary’s to be provided with a reliable figure of the number of patients affected. The breach report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights indicates 301,000 patients have had some of their PHI exposed.

Security safeguards and deterrents were in place at the old facility, although after investigating, SSM Health determined that those safeguards were insufficient to ensure the security of patient information and it was not possible to say, with absolute confidence, that the documents were not viewed by unauthorized individuals during the three and a half years when they were inadequately protected.

While the incident constitutes a data breach and warrants notifications to be sent to patients, SSM Health does not believe patients face a significant risk of misuse of their information due to the limited amount of PHI that was exposed and the age of the data.
However, it does constitute a privacy breach under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The Office for Civil Rights has been notified, and St. Mary’s is in the process of sending notification letters containing additional information to the impacted patients who can be identified and located.
The hospital has now taken steps to ensure that further privacy breaches do not occur including reviewing and revising policies and procedures for record storage, retention, and destruction.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1293.0,30100.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The information was only available to the less than 400 people who had applied for a username and password and that doesn’t necessarily mean any of them saw other patients’ information, Antokol said.

2014,ST. FRANCIS Hospital and Medical Center,CT,Theft,Paper/Films,"Saint Francis Hospital (Conn.) announces 858-patient breach By Patrick Ouellette
 
 January 27, 2014 - In alerting 858 patients that their paper records had been stolen from a doctor’s vehicle on December 27, Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center was able to let them know of the breach quicker than many other organizations. But there are still questions as to why the unsecured records were in the car in the first place.
 
 According to NBC Connecticut, the records were stolen from independent contractor physician Bindu Vanapalli’s car in New Haven, Conn. and included patient names, dates of birth and medical record numbers. Saint Francis, located in Hartford, Conn., said the records did not contain Social Security numbers, financial information or addresses.
 
 Since the breach, Saint Francis has stated that it has implemented internal information safeguards will provide patients with up to two years’ worth credit monitoring for the 858 patients. As in other breach instances, it would be helpful to learn more about its plans to improve physical safeguards. One step may be to prevent physicians, especially those who are contracted, from holding physical records and transport them. Keeping track of digital records can be cumbersome enough, let alone knowing the whereabouts of paper records. While nothing is perfect, cases such as this provide a reminder that EHR systems do have certain privacy and security benefits (assuming there’s encryption involved).
 
 Like other organizations that have experienced breaches, Saint Francis said the breach was a violation of policy and it doesn’t have evidence that there have been attempts to gain inappropriate access to patient data. “Our goal has always been to help ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect our patients’ confidentiality. Education of our staff has already been completed and we are evaluating other opportunities to strengthen our compliance program,” John Rodis, M.D., executive vice president and chief operating officer and chief physician executive, said.

 St. Francis Hospital notifies 858 patients of data breach
 
 St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center said it has notified 858 patients of a privacy breach, after paper medical records were stolen from a physician’s car in New Haven.
 
 The medical records were taken in December from a vehicle belonging to Bindu Vanapalli, an independent contractor physician who works in St. Francis’ emergency department.
 
 The stolen documents contained certain demographic information including patient name, date of birth and medical record number.
 
 Social security numbers, addresses, and other financial information were not included in the stolen materials, the hospital said.
 
 The New Haven Police Department has been involved in the investigation.
 
 St. Francis said it has added internal information safeguards and credit monitoring for up to two years to the 858 patients impacted by the data breach.
 
 Saint Francis Hospital Patient Data Breach
 Saint Francis Hospital Patients data were stolen from independent contractor physician car in New Haven, Conn. Vanapalli is an independent contractor physician who works in the Emergency Department at Saint Francis. There are many questions related to unsecured data presence in the car. Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center notified patients about the breach quicker than many other organizations.
 
 Information included patient names, dates of birth and medical record numbers. It didn’t contain information like Social Security numbers, financial information or addresses.
 
 It shows how organizations need to keep electronic health records, as well as the risks associated with paper copies of records. The incident reinforces the need for electronic health records (EHRs). But also it shows importance of safe guard measures like encryption of laptops, desktops and policy enforcement for better security.
 
 Saint Francis has mentioned that they have implemented internal information safeguards. Credit monitoring for the 858 patients will be provided for two years. It said it will plan to improve physical safeguards. One of the steps includes preventing physicians, especially those who are contracted, from possessing physical records and transport them. So considering incidents like this EHR systems do have certain privacy and security benefits.
 
 Saint Francis said the breach was a violation of policy. It said they didn’t receive any information to related data misuse. John Rodis, M.D., executive vice president and chief operating officer and chief physician executive, said “Our goal has always been to help ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect our patients’ confidentiality. Education of our staff has already been completed and we are evaluating other opportunities to strengthen our compliance program.”",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,15.0,858.0,171600.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2019,ST. FRANCIS Medical Center,MO,HACK,Electronic Medical Record,"MO: Saint Francis Healthcare announces ransomware incident involving Ferguson Medical Group; not all records recovered
 NOVEMBER 21, 2019DISSENT
 Updated Nov. 21: This incident has just been posted on HHS’s public breach tool as impacting 107,054 patients.
 
 Original Post:
 
 Marsha Heller of KAIT 8 reports that Saint Francis Healthcare System announced that Ferguson Medical Group (FMG) in Sikeston, Mo. was hit with a ransomware attack on September 20th.
 
 The following is the notice on Saint Francis Healthcare’s site, explaining that not all records were recoverable from backup:
 
 Notice of Cyber Attack at Ferguson Medical Group
 November 20, 2019
 On September 21, 2019, Saint Francis became aware that the computer network that Ferguson Medical Group, LP (FMG) utilized prior to being acquired by Saint Francis Medical Center experienced a cyber attack on September 20, 2019. As a result of that attack, all of the medical records for services provided at FMG prior to January 1, 2019, were made inaccessible to Saint Francis and they were asked to pay a ransom to regain access to the records. Saint Francis took immediate steps to secure the network and worked with federal law enforcement throughout that process.
 
 Due to many uncertainties in these situations, Saint Francis did not pay a ransom to the attacker, but instead restored access to the medical records through available backup files; however, Saint Francis was not able to restore access to all of the impacted records. Any records for services provided at FMG between September 20, 2018, and December 31, 2018, as well as any documentation that had been scanned into the FMG system, regardless of date, were unable to be restored.
 
 Saint Francis does not believe that this incident resulted in the disclosure of any patient information to any unauthorized third parties. While there is no indication that patient information has been or will be used inappropriately, Saint Francis is notifying all impacted individuals who can be identified and located and is advising them of precautionary steps they can take to protect themselves, including offering complimentary credit monitoring service. Information about how to enroll in the free credit monitoring is available in the letters mailed to patients or by calling the toll-free number Saint Francis established for this matter.
 
 Saint Francis regrets that this incident occurred and is committed to providing quality care and safeguarding personal information. Saint Francis has established a call center to answer any questions that patients may have about this incident. Individuals may contact the call center at 866-611-1186 between 8 am and 8 pm Central time, Monday through Friday.
 
 Saint Francis Healthcare System has announced that the computer network of Ferguson Medical Group has been attacked with ransomware.
 
 The attack occurred on September 21, 2019, before Saint Francis Medical Center acquired the Sikeston, MO-based medical group. Saint Francis Healthcare learned about the ransomware attack on September 21.
 
 According to a notice on the Saint Francis Healthcare website, the attackers succeeded in encrypting medical records of all patients who had received medical services at Ferguson Medical Group prior to January 1, 2019. The incident was reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and steps were immediately taken to isolate the affected systems.
 
 The attackers demanded payment of a ransom for the keys to decrypt files on the network. Since there was no guarantee that the attackers were able to supply working decryption keys and due to other uncertainties, the decision was taken not to pay and to instead recover files from backups.
 
 While many files were recovered, some information could not be restored and has been permanently lost. It was not possible to recover any documentation that had been scanned and saved on its systems, and medical records for patients who received services at Ferguson Medical Group between September 20, 2018 and December 31, 2018 were also permanently lost.
 
 An analysis of the attack uncovered no evidence to suggest the attackers obtained files containing the protected health information of patients prior to encryption and there have been no reports received to suggest any patent information has been misused. However, since it is not possible to rule out unauthorized data access and theft, affected patients have been offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.
 
 The incident has been listed on the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights breach portal. The breach summary indicates 107,054 Ferguson Medical Group patients have been affected. It is not clear how many of those patients have had some or all of their health information lost as a result of the attack.
 
 Ferguson Medical Group Reports Data Loss from Ransomware Attack
 Ferguson Medical Group, owned by Saint Francis Health, was infected with ransomware in September, which caused some data loss; 
 November 21, 2019 - The Missouri-based Saint Francis Healthcare System’s Ferguson Medical Group was hit with a ransomware attack in September 2018, which encrypted all of the medical records for services provided by FMG prior to January 1.
 
 The cyberattack infected the computer network used by FMG before it was acquired by Saint Francis in early 2019. All data contained on the network was rendered inaccessible by the attack, and officials were asked to pay a ransom to regain access.
 
 Upon discovery, Saint Francis immediately took steps to secure the network and worked with federal law enforcement. The health system did not pay the ransom, but restored access to the encrypted files using available backup files.
 However, officials said they were unable to restore access to all of the files encrypted by ransomware. As a result, all records for services provided by FMG between September 20, 2018 and December 31, 2018, including documentation scanned into the FMG system were permanently lost.
 
 “Saint Francis does not believe that this incident resulted in the disclosure of any patient information to any unauthorized third parties,” officials wrote. “There is no indication that patient information has been or will be used inappropriately.”
 
 All individuals from the impacted timeframe are being identified and located and will receive free credit monitoring services.

 SIKESTON, Mo. (KFVS) - Cyber thieves have targeted a clinic in the Heartland by hacking into it’s computer network and holding decades of medical records for ransom.
 
 According to Saint Francis Healthcare System, the computer network at Ferguson Medical Group (FMG) in Sikeston, Mo. experienced a cyber attack on Sept. 20, 2019.
 
 Kathleen Ellison takes her three sons to FMG and said the incident is eye opening.
 
 “Somebody could have gotten my kids records, so it was very scary and kind of heart wrenching,” Ellison said.
 
 The attack happened prior to Saint Francis Medical Center acquiring the health care group at the start of 2019.
 
 Saint Francis President Maryann Reese said they discovered the breach on September 21 and contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigations soon after.
 
 With the FBI’s help, Saint Francis ultimately choose not to pay the cyber thieves.

 “This is an isolated incident with Ferguson Medical Group before they come on with Saint Francis,"" Reese said. “The attack was an accessibility attack. They want ransom money. What they do is they take over the records, they take them over and they want you to pay to get them back. They’re not interested in information.”
 
 Reese said their cyber security department was able to secure Ferguson’s computer network and restore almost all of the clinics lost files using backups.
 
 “Even though no protected health information was in any way compromised, this will make us stronger because we have a heightened awareness around it,"" Reese said. ""Patients deserve to know that their health information is private and secure.”
 
 Experts were unable to restore FMG records between Sept. 20, 2018, and Dec. 31, 2018, as well as any documentation that had been scanned into the FMG system, regardless of date.
 
 Ellison is happy the scope of the breach was limited in size.
 
 “It’s nice that its a smaller gap because its not like an entire history,"" Ellison said. ""I went here with Dr. Blanton when I was a little kid, so if mine was taken they would’ve had to get a binder.”
 
 Saint Francis believe the hackers go in by guessing an employee password and say they're stepping up their security measures.

What they do is they take over the records, they take them over and they want you to pay to get them back. They’re not interested in information.”
 
 Reese said their cyber security department was able to secure Ferguson’s computer network and restore almost all of the clinics lost files using backups.
 
 “Even though no protected health information was in any way compromised, this will make us stronger because we have a heightened awareness around it,"" Reese said. ""Patients deserve to know that their health information is private and secure.”
 
 Experts were unable to restore FMG records between Sept. 20, 2018, and Dec. 31, 2018, as well as any documentation that had been scanned into the FMG system, regardless of date.
 
 Ellison is happy the scope of the breach was limited in size.
 
 “It’s nice that its a smaller gap because its not like an entire history,"" Ellison said. ""I went here with Dr. Blanton when I was a little kid, so if mine was taken they would’ve had to get a binder.”
 
 Saint Francis believe the hackers go in by guessing an employee password and say they're stepping up their security measures.
 
 
 “I would encourage everyone to remember passwords should be complicated and passwords should be changed often,” Reese said. “There are cyber security attacks every single day and not just in healthcare, everywhere. This is just a reality that we’re going to have to live with and we all just have to get smarter than the criminals.”
 
 Saint Francis said it does not believe any patient information was compromised in the cyber attack, but the health care provider is notifying all impacted individuals who can be identified and located.
 
 Those affected will be receiving letters from Saint Francis.
 
 Saint Francis is advising those affected of precautionary steps they can take to protect themselves, including offering complimentary credit monitoring service.
 
 If individuals affected by the cyber attack have any questions about the incident they can contact a call center at 1-866-611-1186 between 9 a.m. through 9 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday.
 
 Saint Francis said there is no indication that patient information in the attack has been or will be used inappropriately.

 AUGUST 25, 2010DISSENT
 The St. John’s Mercy Medical Group (SJMMG) in Missouri has notified patients that one of their physicians, Dr. David Brown, had improperly disposed of medical records.
 
 In a statement on their web site, they say, in part:
 
 On June 9, St. John’s Mercy Medical Group (SJMMG) became aware that Dr. David Brown had improperly disposed of medical records he no longer needed in a dumpster near his Florissant office on June 7 or 8. We believe most, if not all, of those records were safely retrieved and are back in Dr. Brown’s office.
 
 On June 14, during the investigation into the Florissant matter, SJMMG learned that a similar incident occurred on June 7 or 8 at Dr. Brown’s Clayton office where records were not retrieved before being transported to a landfill making them inaccessible. SJMMG has since been investigating both incidents. Letters with an apology and information about what is being done to protect their information have been sent to all patients whose private information may have been involved.
 
 The medical records contained information regarding the care received at Dr. Brown’s offices as well as personal demographic information such as name, address, date of birth, social security number and, in some instances, credit card information. All patients whose medical records were involved have been offered, at no cost to them, 12 months of credit monitoring, identity theft insurance and identity restoration coverage.
 
 Although the notice indicates that disciplinary action has been taken, it is not clear who was disciplined or how.

2014,ST. JOSEPH Health System,TX,HACK,Network Server,"St. Joseph data breach affects 405,000
 February 05, 2014 - St. Joseph Health System (SJHS) in Texas reported a data breach that occurred between December 16 and 18, according to reports from KWTX.com and Theeagle.com. The breach has affected more than 405,000 patients, employees, and employee beneficiaries.
 
 Information was accessed through a single server by hackers from China and other locations. The server contained employee and patient data from for St. Joseph Regional Health Center in Bryan, Burleson St. Joseph Center, Madison St. Joseph Health Center, Grimes St. Joseph Health Center and St. Joseph Rehabilitation Center, the health system said. The server was taken offline after the breach was discovered.
 
 The data included patient names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and possibly addresses. Medical information for patients was accessible, as well as bank information for current and former employees. Investigators could not determine if any information had been extracted.
 
 St. Joseph said that there has been no misuse of information at this time. The health system has set up a confidential call center for affected persons, and is offering free identity-theft protection for one year. The system also said it was in the process of adding new security measures to prevent future occurrences, but did not disclose what those changes were.
 In a release on its website, SJHS noted, “SJHS is working with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is also looking into this incident. SJHS is providing written notice of this incident to affected individuals, to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as to certain state and international regulators.”

 St. Joseph Health System breach leaves thousands of records vulnerable
 St. Joseph Health System officials said Tuesday that more than 405,000 patient and employee records stored on a system server were subject to a two-day data security attack in mid-December.
 
 Tim Ottinger, vice president for the regional health system, said the security breach started Dec. 16 and was discovered two days later by St. Joseph IT employees, who immediately took the server offline.
 
 A large majority of the hacked data consisted of patient records containing names, medical information, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and possibly addresses, Ottinger said.
 He said some of the data contained former and current employee information, including bank accounts.
 
 ""We are very sorry,"" Ottinger said. ""We regret the attack and the result and the potential of exposure to people's information.""
 
 The server accessed, which was just one of many within the system, was comprised of patient and employee data from St. Joseph Regional Health Center in Bryan, Burleson St. Joseph Center, Madison St. Joseph Health Center, Grimes St. Joseph Health Center and St. Joseph Rehabilitation Center.
 
 As of Tuesday, Ottinger said, St. Joseph officials had not received any reports of unusual activity from patients or employees whose information was compromised. All are being sent notification letters informing them of the incident.
 
 Ottinger said forensic investigators were unable to determine if any of the data was extracted by the unauthorized parties.
 The investigators were able to identify the primary IP address involved and traced it back to China, he said, later adding that the FBI was contacted and has opened a case file on the incident.
 
 Anyone whose information was stored on the server was automatically enrolled in free identity protection services for a year and the hospital is also providing them an opportunity to enroll in a free triple-bureau credit monitoring service, Ottinger said.
 
 Additionally, a call center has been set up for St. Joseph patients and employees who want to find out if their information was on the server or to inquire about identity protection. The number for the center, which will operate from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, is 855-731-6011.
 
 Since the data attack, Ottinger said, 10 security measures have been implemented as a means of preventing a similar incident in the future. However, Ottinger declined to discuss any security modifications or additions that have taken place, saying he didn't want to provide hackers with information they could potentially use in their favor.
 
 St. Joseph IT employees are persistently at work fighting off digital intruders, Ottinger said.
 
 ""In talking to our chief information officer, I learned there are hundreds if not thousands of attacks every single day in our system,"" he said. ""There's a constant number of people out there trying to get into the system and trying to access information.""
 
 Ottinger said notifying individuals who potentially were affected is a requirement under Federal Trade Commission regulations.
 
 He stressed that St. Joseph would not be sending out notifications via email and urged anyone who received an email from someone claiming to represent St. Joseph in relation to the incident to contact the health system.

 Between Monday, December 16 and Wednesday, December 18, 2013, SJHS experienced a security attack in which hackers gained unauthorized access to one server on its computer system. SJHS acted quickly, shutting down access to the involved computer on December 18, and hiring national security and computer forensics experts to thoroughly investigate this matter. Our investigation, which is ongoing, determined that this security attack may have resulted in unauthorized access to records for some SJHS patients, employees, and some employees’ beneficiaries. These records included names, social security numbers, dates of birth, and possibly addresses. For the affected patients, medical information was also accessible. For some of the affected employees, bank account information was also accessible.
 
 We are sorry for any trouble or concern that this may have caused our patients, employees and their families. While it is possible that some information was accessed or taken, the forensics investigation has been unable to confirm this, which is why we are providing this notice.

2011,St. Joseph Medical Center,MD,Theft,Other,"Thousands of X-rays stolen from St. Joseph hospital
 By BY ANDREA K. WALKER and THE BALTIMORE SUN
 NOV 04, 2011 | 7:00 PM
 
 Baltimore County police are looking for someone who stole thousands of X-rays from St. Joseph Medical Center in Towson in what they believe was a scheme to extract the silver from the images.
 
 The hospital said Friday that someone posed as a worker for a radiological film destruction company to get access to the X-rays. The theft was believed to have occurred Sept. 11 and discovered five days later. Hospital and police officials did not identify a suspect.
 The hospital says the X-rays were likely stolen for the silver and that it does not think that patient information was a target. X-rays are coated with silver to enhance images. The silver can be removed while destroying the X-rays and then sold.
 
 The theft comprised about 5,000 X-rays and radiological films taken during 2004, 2005 and part of 2007. The films were stored in paper jackets with medical reports and included the patient's name, date of birth, medical record number, date of service, referring physician, the type of study and the radiologist's medical interpretation of the film.
 The film and records did not contain the patient's address, phone number, Social Security number, financial information or health insurance information.

2005,St. Joseph's Hospital (parent: CHRISTUS Health),TX,STAT,Electronic Medical Record,"Patients warned that stolen data could be theirs
 Letters are sent to 16,000 whose records were on computers taken from St. Joseph
 ROBERT CROWE, Copyright 2005 Houston Chronicle Published 5:30 am CDT, Tuesday, April 26, 2005
 
 About 16,000 people are receiving letters from Christus St. Joseph Hospital informing them that a computer stolen in a burglary earlier this year may have contained some of their medical records and Social Security numbers.
 
 The machine was one of two computers taken from Gateway File Systems Inc. between Jan. 15 and 17, when police say a burglar broke a window and entered the company's offices at 2300 Central Parkway.
 
 ""In this incident, the stolen computer may have contained files that included your name, Social Security number, and other personally identifiable information,"" the letter, dated April 10, warned patients.
 From paper to digital files
 Gateway File Systems of Vancouver, British Columbia, was converting paper medical records to digital files for Christus St. Joseph Hospital, said
 India Chumney Hancock , a hospital spokeswoman.
 The hospital since has terminated its contract with Gateway, she said.
 
 Hospital officials say their investigation, coupled with information gathered by the Houston Police Department, indicates the burglars were interested only in the computers and not their data.
 
 ""We have no evidence to believe anyone's identity has been compromised because of this,"" Hancock said.
 
 An HPD spokesman, however, said the incident report gives no information indicating a motive for the burglary.
 
 According to the report, the facility did not have burglar bars, unlike other office spaces nearby.
 
 Hancock said the data that may have been on the computer represents less than 1 percent of all patient records at Christus St. Joseph.
 
 ""If people did not receive a letter, they were not affected,"" she said.
 
 The hospital's letter stresses that the only records potentially affected are for patients who sought treatment in the following departments and dates:
 
 •Emergency room visits from January through December 2004
 •Outpatient visits in radiology, sports medicine and rehabilitation from August through September 2003 and April through June 2004
 •Patient charts from January through December 2001
 Gateway File Systems Chief Executive Officer Brian Harper said the second stolen computer did not contain medical records.
 
 Beating identity theft
 Harper and Hancock said the medical data on the stolen computer was encrypted and protected with passwords.
 
 Hancock said the hospital waited to notify patients because officials did not want the thieves to know what was on the computer.
 
 ""We needed to complete the investigation, generate an accurate list and notify patients as a precaution,"" Hancock said.
 
 According to a 2003 survey by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, 9.9 million people — 4.6 percent of the country's adult population — reported being victims of identity theft.
 
 About half of the victims knew how their identity was stolen.
 
 The report found evidence that suggests that quick discovery of identity theft reduces the risk of thieves opening unauthorized accounts.
 
 Accounts were opened in 45 percent of cases in which at least six months elapsed before victims noticed their information was misused. Accounts were opened in fewer than 10 percent of cases where victims learned of misuse within a month.",1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,90.0,16000.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2012,St. Joseph's Medical Center,CA,Theft,Paper/Films,"PATIENT SERVICE CENTER THEFT HIGHLIGHTS LABS’ NEED TO PROTECT PAPER RECORDS
 By Robert Michel | From the Volume XIX No. 7 - May 14, 2012 Issue
 
  Sarasota Hospital Lab Reduces Number of Hemolyzed SpecimensMagnets to Move Tubes on ARUP’s Testing Line 
 LABS PUT SO MUCH EFFORT INTO SECURING electronic health records, that it’s easy to overlook the need to protect paper records. St. Joseph’s Medical Center in Stockton, California, learned this lesson the hard way recently when thieves stole more than 700 paper records from one of the hospital’s 23 patient service centers (PSC).
 
 The theft showed that paper records and PSCs can be difficult to secure, stated Teresa Bryant, the lab’s Administrative Director, who added that “many of the hospital’s PSCs are in rented facilities where the landlord is responsible for maintaining security.” She stated that, when a window at one PSC was locked— but unmonitored by the security system— thieves broke in and stole three boxes of patient records.
 
 St. Joseph’s Medical Center is a 350-bed hospital that is part of Dignity Health (formerly Catholic Healthcare West-CHW). Its laboratory does reference testing for the entire DignityHealth organization and processes 2,000 requisitions per day.
 
 The theft took place in March and the hospital staff notified each affected patient by mail and posted information on the hospital’s web site. “On February 2, 2012, we discovered that a storeroom window had been broken at the HealthCare Clinical Laboratory (HCCL) Patient Service Center located at 89 W. March Lane, Stockton, and that two storage boxes containing HCCL lab requisition forms were missing from the center,” the hospital said in its notice to patients.
 
 “We were able to determine that the missing lab requisition forms related to certain laboratory services provided between December 13, 2011, and January 5, 2012, and between January 17, 2012, and January 31, 2012.
 
 During our ongoing investigation, on March 16, 2012, we discovered that an additional box of requisition forms was also missing related to services provided between October 24, 2011, and November 18, 2011,” the statement continued. The hospital recommended that patients check their credit ratings and offered free enrollment in a credit monitoring service.
 
 “Since then we moved all the boxes and rechecked all PSCs to ensure they are secure,” Bryant said.
 
 The breach was a violation under the Health Insurance Portability and Affordability Act (HIPPA), requiring the hospital to notify patients and federal and state officials and post an explanation on its website, Bryant added.
 
 Bryant explained that the staff scanned all test requisition forms each day and then stored the paper records onsite in boxes by date of service. “Because we knew which dates were stored in which boxes, we pulled the list of all patients seen on those days and contacted them all,” she said. “The problem was that the records included Social Security numbers, insurance policy numbers, dates of birth, addresses, guarantors’ names, and patients’ names.” Bryant believes the thieves may have used the information to apply for credit cards under the patients’ names.
 
 THE DARK REPORT observes that lab directors should recheck the security at all locations, including rented and leased space, and do not overlook paper records.

 St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital has issued a media announcement providing further information on the 29,156-record data breach that occurred on October 31, 2015. The hospital has explained that the breach occurred when an unidentified individual entered a restricted area of the hospital and stole a thumb drive containing a limited amount of patient data.
 
 The device was unencrypted and contained patient names, medical record numbers, details of imaging services provided, and the dates of patient visits. Some administration information was also stored on the thumb drive, although no financial information, insurance details, health information, or Social Security numbers were compromised.
 
 While the incident was discovered quickly, the hospital had to conduct an investigation to determine the exact data that were stored on the thumb drive and which patients were affected. The investigation has now been completed and patients have been notified by mail of the breach of their protected health information. The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights was informed of the data breach on December 30, 2015.
 
 Although only limited patient data were exposed and the risk of individuals suffering identify theft or financial losses as a result of the breach is relatively low, out of an abundance of caution St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital is providing affected patients with identity theft recovery services for 12 months without charge.
 
 The security breach has prompted St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital to revise its policies on data encryption. All USB drives used by the hospital will now require a password to access data, and the devices will also have patient data encrypted.
 
 The use of thumb drives and other portable storage devices carries a data security risk as they can all too easily be lost or stolen. To reduce the risk of further security incidents of this nature, St. Luke’s will be implementing IT systems that allow data access without the use of thumb drives.

 On November 15, 2012, we learned that on May 21, 2012, one of our employee’s computers had become infected with malware that appears to have been designed to look for personal information stored on the computer. We immediately began an investigation and engaged a computer forensic investigation firm to examine the computer. Although the firm could not rule out the possibility, they did not find any evidence to confirm that any unauthorized person removed the personal information stored on the computer. If an unauthorized person did gain access to files stored on the computer, they would have been able to view billing files that contained patient names, account numbers, medical record numbers, dates of birth, gender, Social Security numbers, treatment dates, insurance provider names, and account balances. No medical records were accessed in the incident.",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,180.0,2988.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2012,St. Mary Medical Center,CA,Loss,Other,"Dear St. Mary Medical Center Patient:
 St. Mary Medical Center is committed to protecting your personal information. This commitment includes notifying our
 patients if we believe that the security of your medical information may have been compromised. We regret to inform you
 that a recent incident may have exposed your medical information to an unintended audience.
 On May 8, 2012, we discovered that an unencrypted thumb drive with patient names, account numbers, diagnosis, dates
 of admission and discharge, physicians’ names, account numbers and medical record numbers was lost. To date, we have
 not been able to locate this thumb drive. The thumb drive did not contain your social security number, your driver’s license
 number or your home address.
 Storing patient information on an unencrypted drive is strictly against Hospital policy. We take this matter very seriously and
 we are investigating it thoroughly. We sincerely regret that this occurred. We are reviewing our security policies and procedures,
 including increasing computer and information technology security education to prevent this from happening again.
 As a precaution, we suggest that you contact any one of the three major credit bureaus and have a “fraud alert” placed on your
 credit file. A fraud alert lets creditors know to contact you before new accounts are opened in your name. You also will be
 automatically sent copies of your current credit files.
 You only need to call one of the credit bureaus, but the fraud alert will be placed in all three files. The three major credit
 bureaus and their toll-free numbers are:
 • Equifax; 1-800-525-6285 or www.equifax.com
 • Experian: 1-888-397-3742 or www.experian.com/fraud
 • TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289 or www.transunion.com
 When you receive your credit reports, examine them carefully. Look for accounts that you did not open. Look for inquiries
 from creditors that you did not initiate. Finally, look for personal information, such as home address and social security
 number to make sure they are accurate. If you see anything that you do not understand, call the credit bureau at the
 telephone number on the report.
 Even if you do not find any signs of fraud, the California Office of Privacy Protection recommends that you check your credit
 reports every three months for the next year. For an official copy of your credit report visit www.annualcreditreport.com.

 Around 4,400 people were recently sent letters by St. Mary’s Medical Center informing them of a cyber attack on several hospital employees’ email accounts that happened in January, according to Randy Capehart, St. Mary’s spokesperson.
 
 Hackers gained access to health information contained in the emails, according to Capehart. Patient information was compromised, including name, date of birth, gender, date of service, insurance information, health information and Social Security numbers in some cases. Capehart said St. Mary’s immediately shut down the email accounts
 
 “It’s not clear if their information was shared because the shutdown was so quick,” Capehart said.

 Substitute Notice – Hacking Attack Incident
 03/05/2015
 
 The privacy and security of patient information is of utmost importance to St. Mary’s Health (“St. Mary’s”), and it has implemented significant security measures to protect such information. Regrettably, despite St. Mary’s efforts to safeguard patient information, a hacking attack has affected St. Mary’s patients and employees.
 
 On December 3, 2014, St. Mary’s learned that several employees’ user names and passwords had been compromised as a result of an e-mail hacking attempt. It immediately shut down the user names and passwords and launched an investigation into the matter. After careful review, St. Mary’s learned on January 8, 2015, that employee e-mail accounts subject to the hacking attempt contained some personal information for approximately 4,400 individuals.
 
 The personal health information in the e-mail account included patient name, date of birth, gender, date of service, insurance information, limited health information and, in some cases, social security numbers. The hackers did not gain access to individual medical records or billing records.
 
 Please be assured that St. Mary’s is taking steps to mitigate this incident by notifying affected individuals via letter, posting this substitute notice and providing notice to prominent media outlets in the area. Identity protection and monitoring services will be offered free of charge as appropriate for affected individuals. Additionally, St. Mary’s is working with its e-mail service provider to evaluate ways to enhance its already robust security program. St. Mary’s will also provide additional education to employees regarding e-mail hacking attacks.
 
 In addition to the steps that St. Mary’s has taken, affected individuals may wish to obtain a free credit report from each of the credit reporting bureaus – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. The credit bureaus’ information is below:

 Posted on February 08, 2007
 
 Critical customer data stolen from both St. Mary's Hospital of Leonardtown and national retail store operator TJX Companies, Inc. Md. Attorney General advises consumers to take steps to protect themselves.
 
 LEONARDTOWN, Md. - A laptop computer containing sensitive patient information was stolen from the Emergency Care Center of St. Mary's Hospital in Leonardtown, Md. According to a letter sent out to certain customers of the hospital, ""The computer contained identifying information including names, social security numbers and birthdates for many of our patients."" The letter further states that ""the laptop did not contain any patient health or financial information,"" even though it is commonly known that social security numbers are the key to anyone's financial information.
 
 Even though the letter is dated Jan. 26, 2007, our source reports that they did not receive the letter until Feb. 7.
 
 To help those whose information was on the compromised computer combat possible identity theft, the hospital says that they have enlisted a private data security firm. The service will essentially monitor credit reports from the three major credit reporting firms and watch for indications of identity theft. However, the letter makes no mention of any relief that the hospital plans to offer anyone who in fact falls prey to identity theft as a result of the computer theft. Identity theft can often require a tremendous number of hours over a long period of time in order to correct the damaged person's credit rating and financial affairs.
 
 The hospital promises customers in their letter that they have taken steps to prevent any future problems: ""New hospital policies have been established to prevent future incidents, and all employees are now required to review the proper procedures for handling sensitive electronic information. Additionally, the missing laptop has been locked out of all hospital systems.""
 
 Letter from St. Mary's Hospital to Customers
 
 January 26, 2007
 
 Administrators at St. Mary's Hospital recently learned that a laptop was taken from the Emergency Care Center. The computer contained identifying information including names, social security numbers and birthdates for many of our patients. It is important to note that the laptop did not contain any patient health or financial information.
 
 At this point, appropriate law enforcement agencies have been notified, and St. Mary's Hospital is fully cooperating to expedite the investigation. Recognizing the urgent nature of this situation, our facility has taken strong measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. Effective immediately, sensitive patient data will no longer be accessible on any portable electronic devices. Furthermore, we are reviewing applications to encrypt data on our laptop computers and implementing password access to provide additional safeguards.
 
 New hospital policies have been established to prevent future incidents, and all employees are now required to review the proper procedures for handling sensitive electronic information. Additionally, the missing laptop has been locked out of all hospital systems.
 
 While you do not need to take any action, there are steps you may take to protect yourself against possible identity theft. Be aware of any suspicious activity as well as phone calls, emails or other communication from individuals asking for your personal information or verification of it.
 
 St. Mary's Hospital has retained National ID Recovery, LLC, an organization specializing in managing situations in which data may have been compromised. If you choose to participate, National ID Recovery will monitor your information for potential identity theft. To enroll in this free program, please call [phone number] to speak one-on-one with a trained paralegal.

 St. Peter's Health Partners is warning of a possible data breach in its email system, following the theft of a manager's cellphone.
 
 Emails on the cellphone may have included patient information related to appointment schedules at St. Peter's Health Partner's Medical Associates, a large doctors' practice.
 
 Most of the potential emails on the phone related to appointments between August and November 2014.
 
 The emails did not include any other medical record information or data related to inpatient hospital treatment or emergency department care, the health system emphasized.
 
 Officials at the health system believe the theft to be random, and that it is unlikely the emails will be discovered or misused. There is no indication, based on current information, that emails have been accessed or viewed, St. Peter's said.
 
 An investigation by St. Peter's officials found, however, that the cellphone was not encrypted in accordance with St. Peter's Health Partners customary security procedures. It was password protected.
 
 In response to the incident St. Peter's said it has taken corrective actions, including a review of all mobile devices networked to the corporate email system to ensure compliance with security procedures.
 
 St. Peter's Health Partners reports potential data breach after cellphone theft
 
 St. Peter's Health Partners, the Albany, New York region's largest hospital system, is notifying 5,117 of its patients that some information about them was involved in a potential data breach after a manager's cellphone was stolen.
 
 The incident affected patients at St. Peter's Medical Associates P.C., one of the system's physician groups. The manager's cellphone had access to corporate email systems, but St. Peter's officials said they received no reports that patient information has been improperly used.
 
 The affected data included scheduling details, such as the patient name and date of birth, as well as the day, time and location of medical appointments, along with a general description of the reason for the appointment. The breach primarily involved data from August to November 2014.
 
 The emails did not include other medical records and personal identity information, such as financial accounts and Social Security numbers. Two patients' home addresses and phone numbers were included in the emails and they were notified previously.
 
 Hospital officials said they learned of the phone theft and potential breach on Nov. 24. They reported it to law enforcement and took other cyber security steps, such as remotely wiping data from the device and disconnecting it from the hospital system's corporate email system. The hospital system, which has about 12,500 employees total, and is the region's largest private-sector employer, announced today it has sent notifications to all 5,117 patients affected by the breach.
 
 ""While at this time we believe the risk is low that the data on these individuals was accessed, we are committed to doing all we can to protect each and every one of them,"" Donald Martin, chief executive officer of SPHP Medical Associates, said.
 
 News of the breach at St. Peter's illustrates how and why cyber security is a major concern among businesses. The issue has drawn added attention as the federal government and business community reacts to North Korea hacking Sony Corp.
 
 Data security is especially key in health care because hospitals and related businesses are controlled by some of the most strict privacy laws intended to protect medical records.
 
 Companies have been investing billions of dollars in recent years to improve cyber security, according to a recent story in the St. Louis Business Journal, an affiliate of the Albany Business Review. The stakes are high considering the average cost of data breach for United States companies last year was $5.85 million, the report shows.
 
 In response to data breach, St. Peter's Health Partners, which is based in Albany, says it is improving its security measures. These steps included a review of the encryption controls on corporate-issued mobile devices and other corrective actions that the hospital didn't disclose.
 
 The stolen cellphone was password protected, but was not encrypted in accordance with St. Peter's Health Partners customary security procedures, according to the hospital system.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,60.0,5117.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 A medical records clerk from St. Peter’s Hospital was arrested on charges of stealing patients’ personal information and using it to open credit card accounts, police said, and more unknowing victims could be out there.
 
 Albany County Sheriff’s deputies arrested Johnathan Harwood, 23, of Van Buren Avenue, on Monday for opening credit accounts using stolen Social Security numbers and then purchasing merchandise over the Internet. Police said Hardwood was also using the computers at the hospital to purchase items online.
 
 Undersheriff Craig Apple said Harwood was purchasing small items such as books, to see if he could get away with the crime. “He was testing the waters,” the undersheriff said.
 
 
 The man, who had worked in the Medical Records Unit for a little less than a year, was discovered when an item he bought online was sent to a victim’s house, Apple said.
 
 The victim reported it to police, who were able to track it back to the computer used to make the purchase. St. Peter’s Hospital administrators immediately suspended Harwood after his arrest. He has since been fired.
 
 Harwood was charged with five counts of second-degree forgery and three counts of second-degree identity, both felonies, and three counts of second-degree criminal impersonation, a misdemeanor. He was arraigned in Albany City Court and released for a future court date since he has no previous criminal record.
 
 Apple said the sheriff’s office is looking for more people who may have had their identities stolen by Hardwood. Those who think they may be affected should call 765-2351.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,30.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 Substitute Notice – May 15, 2014 Incident
 St. Vincent Breast Center
 
 The privacy and security of patient information is of utmost importance to the St.Vincent Hospital and Health Care Center Inc. -Breast Center (“Center”) and we have implemented significant security measures to protect such information. Regrettably, despite the Center’s efforts to safeguard patient information, there has been an unauthorized disclosure of certain patient protected health information that included patient names, addresses, and in some cases, a reference to a scheduled appointment. The information did not include patients’ social security numbers, financial information or any other clinical information.
 
 In order to comply with legal obligations for the closing of their practices, the Indianapolis Breast Center, P.C. and Solis Women’s Health Breast Imaging Specialists of Indiana P.C. (collectively referred to as the “Practice”) entered into an agreement with the Center to transfer medical records of patients to the Center effective December 10, 2013. The Center became responsible for facilitating access to the records.
 
 On May 5, 2014, the Center mailed approximately 63,325 letters intended for prior Practice patients to inform them the Center was available to provide care or to welcome Practice patients who had previously scheduled health care services. Beginning on May 15, 2014, the Center began responding to calls from individuals who received another individual’s letter in error. The Center, working with the cooperation of the Practice, immediately launched a thorough investigation of the matter and found that a clerical error resulted in letters being sent to the wrong individuals.
 
 As noted above, no social security numbers or financial information were included in these letters. There is no evidence to believe that the information has been or will be accessed or used for fraudulent purposes. The Center and Practice have made several attempts to secure correct names and addresses of patients in order to provide individual notice of the disclosure. Unfortunately, it has been determined that the names and addresses used to send the mailings may not be current and cannot be verified. Since correct names and addresses cannot be confirmed, this substitute notice is in lieu of individual notices.
 
 Please be assured that the Center is taking steps to mitigate this incident by notifying affected individuals through this substitute notice, media notice, and destroying all letters that have been returned. The Center is also evaluating and making changes to its patient mailing processes internally and with external vendors to avoid an incident of this nature in the future.
 
 In addition to the steps the Center has taken, affected individuals may wish to consider taking additional steps to protect themselves against any possible fraudulent misuse of their information. If applicable, an affected individual should monitor his or her bank, credit card and other bills/statements in detail for the next year. The affected individuals may wish to obtain a credit report from each of the credit reporting bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion).

The announcement indicates that the computer has location services software that signals its whereabouts when connected to the internet. However, officials report no detection at this time.
  
  The protected health information (PHI) contained on the device comprises for the most part patient names, medical record numbers, and the location of their services; however, a small portion of the health data are Social Security numbers. As a result, the hospital is offering affected individuals identity protection services at no cost as well as a toll-free help line, (855) 731-6016, Monday through Friday, 6AM–6PM PST.
  
  An investigation involving the local law enforcement is currently ongoing and has yet to reveal any information.

2013,Stanford School of Medicine & Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford,CA,Theft,Laptop,"STANFORD, Calif. - Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford and the Stanford University School of Medicine are notifying patients by mail that a password-protected laptop computer containing limited medical information on pediatric patients was stolen from a physician’s car away from campus on the night of January 9, 2013. This incident was reported to Packard Children’s and the School of Medicine on January 10. Immediately following discovery of the theft, Packard Children’s and the School of Medicine launched an aggressive and ongoing investigation with security and law enforcement, and began contacting patients potentially affected.
  
  The medical information on the stolen laptop was predominantly from 2009 and related to past care and research. The patient data did not include financial or credit card information, nor did it contain Social Security numbers or any other marketable information. It did include names and dates of birth, basic medical descriptors, and medical record numbers, which are used only by the hospital to identify patients. In some cases, there was limited contact information. There is no indication that any patient information has been accessed or compromised.
  
  Packard Children’s and the School of Medicine continue working diligently with law enforcement to recover the laptop.
  
  Individuals potentially affected are being offered the option of free identity protection services, and a toll-free phone line has been established for any questions families may have. The number is (855) 731-6016, and is available Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST.
  
  Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital and the School of Medicine strive to be industry leaders in the area of medical information security. As a result of this incident, we are taking additional steps to further strengthen our policies and controls surrounding the protection of patient data, including redoubling our efforts to ensure that all computers and devices containing medical information are encrypted.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1.0,56500.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2011,Stanford University Hospital and Clinics,CA,DISC,Other,"Private medical data for nearly 20,000 emergency room patients at California’s prestigious Stanford Hospital were exposed to public view for nearly a year because a billing contractor’s marketing agent sent the electronic spreadsheet to a job prospect as part of a skills test, the hospital and contractors confirmed this week. The applicant then sought help by unwittingly posting the confidential data on a tutoring Web site.
  
  In an e-mail sent to a victim of the breach, the billing contractor, Joe Anthony Reyna, president of Multi-Specialty Collection Services in Los Angeles, explained that his marketing vendor, Frank Corcino, had received the data directly from Stanford Hospital, converted it to a new spreadsheet and then forwarded it to a woman he was considering for a short-term job.
  
  The position was with Mr. Corcino’s one-man shop, Corcino & Associates, Mr. Reyna wrote in the e-mail, which was authenticated by his lawyer, Ellyn L. Sternfield. The job applicant apparently was challenged to convert the spreadsheet — which included names, admission dates, diagnosis codes and billing charges — into a bar graph and charts, Stanford Hospital officials said.
  
  Not knowing that she had been given real patient data, the applicant posted it as an attachment to a request for help on studentoffortune.com, which allows students to solicit paid assistance with their work. First posted on Sept. 9, 2010, the spreadsheet remained on the site until a patient discovered it on Aug. 22 and notified Stanford.
  
  The hospital, located on the campus of Stanford University in Palo Alto, demanded that the spreadsheet be removed, and the Web site quickly complied. Pressed for time, the job prospect wound up completing the assignment herself and, in the end, did not get hired, Ms. Sternfield said.
  
  Mr. Corcino, in his first public statement, attributed the breach to “a chain of mistakes which are far too easy to make when handling electronic data.”
  
  When the breach was first reported by The New York Times on Sept. 8, it was not clear how the data had made it to the Web.
  
  Breaches of private medical data have become distressingly commonplace, with two substantial ones disclosed in the last week alone.
  
  In Orlando, officials with Florida Hospital reported that three employees had improperly combed through emergency department records of 2,252 patients, apparently to forward information about accident victims to lawyers. The employees were fired, and law enforcement officials are investigating.
  
  Meanwhile, Science Applications International Corporation disclosed that computer backup tapes containing medical data for 4.9 million military patients had been stolen from an employee’s car in San Antonio. The data included Social Security numbers, clinical notes, laboratory test results and prescriptions. The company said the risk of harm was low because retrieving data from the tapes would require specialized knowledge, software and hardware.
  
  The Texas breach is by far the largest since September 2009, when a new federal law began requiring disclosures of medical privacy violations involving at least 500 people. Some 330 such episodes have been tallied, including four others that affected more than one million people each.
  
  Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services said the new reporting requirements had exposed deep vulnerabilities and encouraged renewed vigilance.
  
  
  
  Private information for almost 20,000 patients was released.“We’re moving in the right direction in terms of a culture of compliance,” said Leon Rodriguez, director of the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which investigates medical privacy cases. “Are there still a lot of problems out there? Yeah, my sense is there are still a lot of problems.”
  
  The Stanford breach was notable for the duration of public exposure, and for spotlighting the vulnerability created by a medical provider’s business relationships with outside parties.
  
  Last week, lawyers filed suit in state court in Los Angeles, seeking certification as a class action and $20 million in damages from Stanford Hospital & Clinics and Multi-Specialty Collection Services, which is known as MSCS. The threat of liability set off a predictable round of finger-pointing.
  
  In written responses to questions, Lisa Lapin, Stanford University’s assistant vice president for university communications, said, “MSCS bears the complete and sole responsibility for the breach.”
  
  Ms. Lapin said the hospital had sent the data in encrypted form to Mr. Corcino, who requested it on behalf of MSCS to analyze a strategy for improving billing collections. She said Mr. Corcino had regularly represented himself as MSCS’s executive vice president and had been Stanford’s “primary contact” during a seven-year relationship. MSCS, a five-person firm that audits hospital accounts to maximize reimbursement, possessed the passwords to unencrypt the data, she said.
  
  “This mishandling of private patient information was in complete contravention of the law and of the requirements of MSCS’s contract and is shockingly irresponsible,” the hospital said in a statement.
  
  Ms. Sternfield, Mr. Reyna’s lawyer, said Mr. Corcino had never been an MSCS employee, but rather was paid a monthly fee to drum up business, typically in face-to-face meetings with health care executives. Mr. Reyna, she said, had no knowledge that the Stanford data had been sent to Mr. Corcino, or that he had passed it on.
  
  Mr. Corcino was not authorized to use an MSCS title, Ms. Sternfield said, but she declined to say whether Mr. Reyna was aware of the practice. She acknowledged that Mr. Corcino sometimes used an MSCS e-mail account.
  
  In his e-mail to the breach victim, who shared it with The Times, Mr. Reyna wrote that Stanford had sent the file to Mr. Corcino “for a potential MSCS project that would audit paid accounts to verify that the reimbursement was correct.”
  
  For his part, Mr. Corcino said in a statement that he was an independent contractor but was “the marketing face of the company,” and that MSCS “allowed me to use the title of executive vice president.” He wrote: “Stanford sent the file to me at MSCS, and I imported the data into a spreadsheet that was forwarded to the job applicant as part of a skills test. I did not intend to provide any personal health information in the file. This was a marketing project.”
  
  Without explaining how or why he sent the data to the applicant, Mr. Corcino said MSCS had not trained him properly and faulted Stanford for sending him private information that he did not need. That, he said, was the “first link in a chain of mistakes.”
  
  “I regret that Stanford released a file containing unnecessary information,” Mr. Corcino said, “that MSCS did not have an appropriate training and audit system for the handling of electronic data and that I was not more careful with the file. While Stanford and MSCS left the information in the file I received, it was my mistake to not catch its inclusion and remove the data.”
  
  The hospital has terminated its relationship with MSCS, and Mr. Reyna has done the same with Mr. Corcino.
  
  Stanford Hospital has reassured affected patients that the posted spreadsheet did not contain Social Security numbers, birthdates or credit card numbers, and has offered free identity theft protection services. The hospital said it had not uncovered any misuse of the exposed data.",0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,345.0,20000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,20000000.0,0.0

  Although it is not always the case, medical organizations are known to be the target of successful cyber-attacks because of insufficient security measures or practices regarding the protection of the personal information stored on their systems.
  
  When a breach occurs, most of the times, the impacted organization provides some hints about what happened, allowing the affected individuals understand the nature of the incident, as well as the steps taken to avoid data leaks in the future.

  However, in the case of a security incident that occurred on April 5, 2015, at Stanislaus Surgical Hospital in Modesto, California, only the most essential information has been made public.
  
  Apart from the date of the breach, which apparently was discovered the same day, and the type of data exposed to a third party, whose origin remains a mystery, there isn’t much to be gathered from the disclosure letter to the impacted people.
  
  Names, addresses, account numbers, social security numbers “and other identifying information” may have been exposed during the event. It is unclear if this is the result of an employee improperly handling the details, or of a cybercriminal attack.
  
  Police is investigating, free identity protection service offered
  The number of the individuals affected by this incident remains unknown, too, but since the hospital informed the California Office of the Attorney General, it is safe to assume that at least 500 people are currently affected.
  
  The incident has been reported to the local police department, who has initiated an investigation. There is no indication that the breach was a consequence of malicious intent or that the data fell into the wrong hands.
  
  Nevertheless, the hospital informs that it is “actively working on enhanced security measures” in order to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future.

 Stolen SIUH computer has data for 88,000, and former patients have growing concern
 Sunday, May 11, 2008
 By GLENN NYBACK
 STATEN ISLAND
 
 STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- As tens of thousands of Staten Island University Hospital patients seethe over the decision by hospital administrators to wait four months before informing them that a computer containing their personal information was stolen, SIUH's chief executive conceded officials could have handled the situation differently.
 
 The hospital only 10 days ago began informing 88,000 patients whose names, Social Security and health insurance numbers were included on a password-protected desktop computer stolen from the hospital's Rosebank billing office in December.
 
 ""In taking a look at this, could it have been done sooner? I believe perhaps it could have been done sooner,"" said Anthony Ferreri, SIUH president and CEO.
 
 He explained that the hospital decided that before notifying people, it chose to complete an eight-to-nine-week process to identify a credit-monitoring program for all 88,000 patients with the national credit-reporting agency Equifax.
 
 ""We wanted to make certain we had the best possible vendor with the experience in the particular area who could protect the credit and the information of those who were affected,"" Ferreri said.
 
 Most patients affected included those who were treated at the hospital in 2007, but 29 people, treated between 2001 and 2006 who have outstanding billing accounts, are also in that database, according to hospital spokesman John Demoleas, who added that all the letters had been mailed out by May 1.
 
 All 88,000 were offered a year of free credit monitoring from Equifax. When asked if patients could have been notified of the theft first and received follow-up information about the credit monitoring later, Ferreri conceded that possibility.
 
 ""I can't entirely argue with that position,"" he said. ""By releasing the story too early, we were also concerned that the perpetrator might very well realize that he in fact had information that was of some value.""
 
 Police have not made any arrests in the case.
 
 Several readers who've contacted the Advance said they hope people will band together to file a class-action lawsuit against the hospital to teach it a lesson.
 
 One of them is Dawn Bertoldo, of Dongan Hills, who was admitted to Staten Island University Hospital in August 2007. She never suspected she'd have to worry about her identity being compromised a few months later.
 
 What irks Ms. Bertoldo most, however, isn't the possibility of her Social Security and health insurance information being sold to strangers, but that she found out from a newspaper story rather than from the hospital.
 
 ""You feel victimized and you feel violated,"" said Ms. Bertoldo of Dongan Hills, who pointed a critical finger at hospital administrators for waiting four months before letting anyone know about the theft.
 
 ""Right now, I'm looking at a hospital not doing the right thing and I think they have a responsibility to. If they're bound by law to protect my identity and keep it private, and they are compromised and can't do that anymore, it's both courtesy and common sense that you inform people.""
 
 The hospital had no comment on plans for litigation.
 
 Because people younger than 18 typically don't have credit reports on file, the theft has raised questions among parents whose children's information was on the database.
 
 Isabella Bertelli-Vecchio of Huguenot, whose 16-month-old son Pietro received a notification letter last week, said an Equifax representative told her the only way to find out if his identity is stolen is to monitor the situation. If a credit report appears, it likely means someone has used his information, she said.
 
 ""I find it a very scary proposition to do a sit-and-wait game, when a compromised credit file could affect college entrance and even possibly health insurance when he is of age, not to mention the normal things of car [and] home loans,"" she said.
 
 What merit a lawsuit would have, though, is unknown; there have been no indications that personal information has been used, according to hospital officials and police.
 
 ""It would depend on the damages,"" said one Island business law expert, who asked to remain anonymous. If patients' credit isn't compromised, ""the damages are minimal. When you sue for negligence, you have to prove damages.""
 
 Experts differ on what the impact of the theft could be, but agree that affected patients should take precautions to guard against their identities being stolen.
 
 If the personal information hasn't been used yet, it probably won't be, said Jeff Sovern, a law professor at St. John's University School of Law. In fact, in most cases where computer equipment is stolen, it's taken for its value and not the information stored within it, he added.
 
 ""I don't see why an identity thief would sit on the data,"" said Sovern, who among other subjects teaches consumer protection. ""In most cases, available evidence suggest nothing will be done with the information. But that doesn't mean this won't be the exception.""
 
 A June 2007 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that ""most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft.""
 
 Of the 24 largest breaches reported between January 2000 through June 2005, ""GAO found that three included evidence of resulting fraud on existing accounts and one included evidence of unauthorized creation of new accounts.""
 
 But Tami Nealy, who represents the identity theft prevention and protection company Lifelock, said identity thieves are ""savvy"" and can hold on to information more than a year beyond the period of credit monitoring offered by the hospital.
 
 Credit monitoring ""is similar to an alarm on your house -- it just alerts you to the problems, it doesn't stop them,"" Ms. Nealy said, and urged SIUH's patients to be vigilant. ""It's just another person out there with your personal information. Just be aware.""
 
 For people worried about their identities and who don't want to wait for the hospital's credit-monitoring service to alert them of any problems, there are a couple of options, Sovern said.
 
 The first step would be to obtain your credit report from Equifax or the other two national credit-reporting firms, Experian and TransUnion (people are entitled to one free credit report annually), to look for any unusual activity.
 
 Second, people can request that a ""security freeze"" be put on their accounts, necessitating a pin code in order to access information about their credit.
 
 Finally, patients can notify any of those three credit monitors to put a ""fraud alert"" on their credit report, which causes banks and credit companies to take extra precautions and ask more personal questions than normal when handling credit card and loan applications, Sovern said.
 
 Once filed, companies are required to pass fraud alert information on to the other two agencies. They are free and must be renewed every 90 days.

2007,Stevens Hospital,WA,DISC,Other,"Hospital says private patient info was accessible on web
 Jun 4, 2007
 
 Stevens Hospital said the private records of more than 500 patients -- including their Social Security numbers -- were inadvertently allowed to be accessed on the internet recently.
 
 Officials at the Edmonds hospital said the information was available on the web ""following a lapse in a subcontractor's computer security."" They added that the privacy of the patients' records has been restored and that the information available included names and addresses of patients, but not credit card information.
 
 The hospital didn't specify how long the records were available to search engines and officials said they're contacting patients affected by the security problem.
 
 ""We regret any concerns or inconvenience this incident may cause (patients),"" said Mike Carter, hospital president and CEO, in a statement.

In connection with Ambucor’s work with Stony Brook Internists, UFPC, Ambucor had access to some of your information and to information about the cardiology services provided to you.
 
 Ambucor has been investigating the activities of a former Ambucor employee, and that investigation has revealed that this former employee downloaded certain Stony Brook Internists, UFPC patient information to thumb drives and retained those drives on March 17, 2016 shortly before his employment at Ambucor ended. The former employee is currently incarcerated on unrelated charges. Ambucor has been working with federal law enforcement concerning this incident and has been cooperating fully in the ongoing investigation. As a result of those ongoing efforts, federal law enforcement authorities recently provided Ambucor with two thumb drives that this former employee turned over to them after his departure from Ambucor. On or about July 27, 2016, in connection with this investigation, Ambucor determined that the thumb drives contained Stony Brook Internists, UFPC patient data. However, it was not until September 2016 – when Ambucor completed a detailed review of the forensic and other data contained on the thumb drives – that we discovered that your personal information had been downloaded.
 
 Please note that the thumb drives do NOT include your Social Security number, credit or debit card numbers, medical insurance or Medicare/Medicaid numbers, or other financial information, and no such information about you has been compromised.
 
 This downloaded information may include your first and last name, phone number, diagnosis, medications, date of birth, race, home address, testing data (i.e., type of test, test results, date of test and whether testing was monthly or not), patient identification number, medical device information (i.e., manufacturer, identification number, and model/serial numbers), Ambucor enrollment number, Ambucor enrollment date, Ambucor technician name, physician name(s), and the name and address of the practice where you were seen.
 
 As of this writing, Ambucor has received no information indicating that any of your personal information has been misused.
 
 Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, Ambucor is offering you one year of identity protection services at no cost to you. Your year-long membership in CSID Protector coverage, provides you with increased visibility into possible fraudulent activity, access to a team of Identity Restoration Specialists to guide you through the recovery process if needed, and up to $1 million of identity theft insurance for covered expenses.

 Steps To Protect The Security Of Your Health Information
 
  
 
 Medical identity theft is unlikely when health information without individual identifiers, such as Social Security number, health insurance number, or Medicaid number, is compromised, but taking the following steps could help reduce the risk of misuse.
 
 Review Your Billing Statements. You should carefully review the billing statements that you receive from healthcare providers for potentially fraudulent charges, such as charges for services that you did not receive, charges for office visits that you did not make, and charges for medical equipment that you did not receive.
 Remain Vigilant For Signs Of Suspicious Activity. If you notice any of the following signs of possible medical identity theft, contact the relevant health care provider or insurance company:
 A call from a debt collector about a medical debt you don’t owe;
 Medical collection notices on your credit report that you don’t recognize; or
 A denial of insurance because your medical records show a condition you don’t have.
 Obtain Copies Of Your Medical Files. Federal law gives you the right to know what is in your medical records. If you suspect that your personal information has been misused, contact each doctor, clinic, hospital, pharmacy, laboratory, and location where a thief may have used your information. For example, if a thief got a prescription in your name, ask for records from the health care provider who wrote the prescription and the pharmacy that filled it. You may need to pay for copies of your records, but no more than the fee necessary for the provider to prepare and transmit the records. Check the records for errors. Each health care provider’s notice of privacy practices will provide you with additional information regarding how to submit an access request. You have the right to request a copy of the privacy notice at any time. 
 Correct Your Medical Records. If you discover upon reviewing copies of your medical records that any information is inaccurate, you have the right to request that the information be corrected. Write to your medical providers and explain which information is not accurate. Send copies of the documents that support your position. You can include a copy of your medical record and circle the disputed items. Ask the provider to correct or delete each error. Keep the original documents. The medical provider that made the mistakes in your files generally is required to change the information. If a medical provider will not make the changes you request, ask it to include a statement of your dispute in your record.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,130.0,1878.0,187800.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2010,Strong Memorial Hospital,NY,DISC,Other,"About half of the 2,500 patient bills Strong Memorial Hospital mailed on April 19 went to the wrong patients, and this week the hospital sent letters apologizing to affected people and telling them to be alert to any possible misuse of their information.
  
  Spokeswoman Teri D’Agostino said a machine that folds and stuffs the bills into windowed envelopes malfunctioned. Patient calls revealed something went wrong and it took time to determine who was affected, she said. April 19 happened to be a heavy billing day.
  Billing statements included the patient’s name, the name and address of the person responsible for the bill, a vague description of the services received, dates of service, dollar amount owed, health insurance plan and subscriber number — unless the subscriber number contained the patient’s Social Security number, as with Medicare, according to the letter from Adam Anolik, director of financial services.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,1250.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2019,Summa Health,OH,HACK,Email,"AKRON, Ohio – More than 500 patient medical records and other personal information are at-risk as a result of an email phishing incident that targeted Summa Health employees.
  
  The Akron-based health system announced Friday it is sending letters to patients whose information may have been accessed by an “unauthorized person” who gained control of employee email accounts.
  
  On May 1, Summa Health learned that an outside party gained access to a “limited number” of employee email accounts. Phishing refers to emails that look legitimate and ask people to click on links or input personal information, which can compromise security.
  
  
  Two employee email accounts were accessed in August 2018, and two others were accessed between March 11 and March 29, the health system said.
  
  After securing the accounts, Summa Health hired a computer forensic firm and began an investigation. The investigation was not able to determine whether the unauthorized person actually viewed any emails or attachments.
  
  The emails and attachments contained patient names, dates of birth, medical records, patient account numbers, clinical and treatment information for more than 500 patients, Summa Health spokesman Jim Gosky told cleveland.com. Not all Summa patients are affected.
  
  For a “small subset of patients,” the accounts also contained health insurance information, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers.
  
  When asked why the health system, which learned about the breach on May 1, did not alert patients until the end of June, Gosky said, “As soon as we learned of the unauthorized access, we worked diligently to investigate the incident. This process was time and labor-intensive and we wanted to be certain about who may have been impacted and what information was involved.”
  
  
  Summa Health recommends patients review statements from their healthcare providers and health insurers.
  
  “If they see services that the patient did not receive, they should contact the provider or insurer immediately. For eligible patients whose Social Security number or driver’s license number was found in the email accounts, Summa Health is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services,"" the health system said.
  
  Anyone with questions can call 1-855-657-2227, Monday through Friday, between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
  
  “To help prevent something like this from happening in the future, Summa Health is reinforcing employee training on privacy and security and is instituting additional security measures throughout the health system,” Summa said.",0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,50.0,500.0,50000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2011,Sutter Health,CA,Theft,Laptop,"A desktop computer with personal data on 4.24 million patients was stolen from a Sacramento medical office a month ago, Sutter officials announced Wednesday morning.
  
  The computer was protected with a password, but the stolen records were not encrypted. Experts say this means a data thief with modest technical skills could easily access the records.
  
  Sutter officials said the stolen data do not include patient financial records, Social Security numbers or health plan identification numbers. But the information does include other personal and medical information for nearly a million patients in the Sacramento area, as well as those with medical groups in Solano County that merged into the Sutter Medical Foundation on Jan. 1.
  
  The theft occurred during the weekend of Oct. 15 and Sutter immediately reported it to Sacramento police. But the health system waited to notify the public while it worked to determine the extent of the loss.
  
  In a message to patients on the health system’s website, Sutter officials said they “wanted to make sure we fully understood what data was contained on the stolen computer so we could give you comprehensive and accurate information. That took some time.”
  
  Sutter president and chief executive Pat Fry, in the message to patients, said the health system takes the data breach very seriously.
  
  “Sutter Health holds the confidentiality and trust of our patients in the highest regard, and we deeply regret that this incident has occurred,” he said. Sutter was “in the process of encrypting computers throughout our system when the theft occurred, and we have accelerated these efforts.”
  
  The computer was stolen after someone threw a rock through a window at the business office of Sutter Medical Foundation at 2750 Gateway Oaks in Sacramento. The thief took a computer screen, keyboard and other equipment, Sutter spokesman Bill Gleeson said.
  
  The theft affects two groups of patients.
  
  Data on 3.3 million patients whose health care providers contract with Sutter Physician Services, mostly in the Bay Area, includes name, address, date of birth, phone, e-mail, medical record number and health insurance provider.
  
  It’s worse for another 943,000 patients.
  
  In addition to the information provided for all patients, for the second group the computer contained dates of service, descriptions of medical diagnoses and procedures from January 2005 to January 2011.
  
  These patients will receive letters notifying them of the theft by Dec. 5, Sutter said.
  
  The health system also set up a toll-free telephone line to answer questions: (855) 770-0003. When prompted, callers should enter the following reference code: 7637111511.
  
  Computer experts were critical of Sutter's data security procedures. This kind of information should be stored on a secure server rather than on individual computers, said Thor Severson, co-owner of CMIT Solutions of Sacramento, which provides managed computer support and security.
  
  Password protection on a computer provides only elementary protection, Severson said. The records can easily be accessed by physically taking the drive out of the computer.
  
  On the positive side, the information stolen appears to have no financial value, Severson noted. “I don’t know the situation. I’m from the outside looking in, but what is the value of that information for most people? I can see it is private information, but I can’t see it having any value,” he said.

 Sutter Health Sued for 4.24M HIPAA Mega Breach
 Posted By HIPAA Journal on Nov 30, 2011
 
 Two class action lawsuits have now been filed against the Sutter Health hospital system in Northern California after a burglary at its administrative offices in Sacramento potentially exposed the Protected Health Information of 4.24 million patients.
 
 Over the weekend of Oct 15-16 thieves gained access to the offices by throwing a rock through the window. Once inside they cleared the office of electrical equipment including a PC, mouse and computer monitors. The PC contained data relating to 3.3 million former and current patients of Sutter Physician Services (SPS) with the records dating back to 1995. Social Security numbers were not included in the data although some personally identifiable information could potentially have been accessed by the thieves. The data included names, dates of births, addresses, phone numbers and some email addresses.
 
 The breach also exposed the medical records of 943,000 patients from the Placer, Sacramento, Solano, Sutter, Yolo and Yuba counties who had been treated by Sutter Medical Foundation doctors from January 2005 to the present.
 
 One of the lawsuits has been filed on behalf of Javier Garcia by the Harris & Rubel Law firm against both Sutter Medical Foundation and Sutter Physician Services for failing to implement adequate controls to keep patient data secure.
 
 Sutter Health had a policy of data encryption and many hard drives had been encrypted; however the process took time and mobile devices were given priority. Laptops and Blackberry devices had their data encrypted but Sutter Health had only just started its PC data encryption program and the process had not been completed, although the stolen PC was protected by a password. The Sutton Health program of data encryption started in 2007.
 
 A second class action lawsuit has been filed in Sacramento by the Dreyer Babich Buccola Wood law firm which is representing Karen Pardieck, with damages of $1,000 being claimed for each of the 4.24 million victims.
 
 Sutter Health reported the theft to the Sacramento Police Department as soon as the break-in was discovered and investigations are continuing. There is no reason to suggest that the office was targeted specifically for the data the PCs contained, although it is possible that the data has been accessed by the individuals in possession of the equipment.
 
 Due to the volume of breach notification letters Sutter Health was required to send the process took two weeks to complete, with the first letters sent on Nov 15 with all communications dispatched by Nov 29. The healthcare provider has been criticized by some patients for delaying sending the letters for a month, although HITECH require notifications to be sent within 60 days so they were sent well before the legal deadline.
 
 According to Sutter Health Spokesperson, Nancy Turner, the delay in issuing the breach notifications was due to the time it took to identify the data contained on the PC. Once this was ascertained the notifications were prepared and sent. Patients have been advised that they should receive the communication by December 5th and if not it is unlikely that they have been affected.
 
 Sutter Health has set up a toll free number (855-770-0003) for any individual concerned about the incident to receive further information.

2013,"Sutter Health East Bay Region: Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, Sutter Delta Medical Center, Eden Medical Center",CA,Other,Other,"A drug raid by police in California has resulted in Sutter Health notifying about 4,500 of its patients about a security incident, the third major breach the organization has reported since October 2011.
  
  Sutter Health posted a notice on its website June 7 stating that the Alameda County Sheriff's Department recently notified one of Sutter Health's hospitals in the East Bay area of Northern California that during an unrelated investigation, authorities recovered information about the Sutter Health patients.
  
  ""We do not know what law enforcement was investigating when they obtained this information,"" the notice states. ""The information may have originated from Sutter Health's Alta Bates Summit, Sutter Delta or Eden medical centers, and may have included a patient's name, Social Security number, date of birth, gender, address, ZIP code, home phone number, marital status, name of employer and work phone number.""
  
  The statement says that ""while it is presently unclear where the information originated, we have notified the patients whose information was potentially involved and are offering them free credit monitoring services. We have also alerted the appropriate government agencies.""
  
  A Sutter Health spokeswoman tells HealthcareInfoSecurity that the organization is cooperating with police in the investigation, and that Sutter has its own internal investigation under way. She says the delivery system does not know whether the patient information found by police was on paper or electronic or whether ID theft or fraud is suspected. Sutter Health also does not know whether two individuals arrested by police have employment or other ties to the organization.
  
  Police have not yet determined how the arrested individuals gained access to the Sutter patient information, but so far there is no indication that any related ID theft has occurred, says Alameda County police officer J.D. Nelson, who declined to elaborate on details of the case since it's still under investigation.
  
  Sutter Health includes 24 hospitals, 27 ambulatory care facilities, a network of more than 5,000 physicians, and home healthcare and hospice services in Northern California.
  
  Other Breaches
  In October 2011, Sutter Health reported the theft from its Sutter Medical Foundation of an unencrypted desktop computer containing information 4.2 million patients (see: Computer Theft Affects 4.2 Million). That incident resulted in the filing of 11 class action lawsuits. Those suits were consolidated into one case, which is making its way through Sacramento County Superior Court.
  
  In addition, Sutter Health reported a May 2011 breach at its Sutter Gould Medical Foundation in which lost paper records resulted in 1,920 patients being notified that their information was possibly compromised. That incident appears on the Department of Health and Human Services breach website that lists incidents involving 500 or more individuals.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,4500.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

  How many victims? 45,000.
  
  What kind of personal information? Names, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and Social Security numbers. In some cases, the data included billing and diagnosis information.
  
  What happened? The contractor, who was performing an equipment upgrade, violated hospital policy when he downloaded the data onto the hard drive of a laptop.
  
  What was the response? The hospital mailed notification letters to the victims. In addition, it plans to provide additional training to managers, conduct audits of portable devices and re-evaluate its security polices.
  
  Details: The laptop was password protected but not encrypted. The hospital now plans to encrypt all of its computers. The contractor was fired.

Joanne Suffis, vice president of Human Resources, said the incident was highly unusual. Swedish is providing affected people with free access to an identity-theft service.
  
  The employees worked for Swedish Medical Center in 1994, 1995, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2006. Some are still employed at Swedish.
  
  The breach occurred in April, when a Swedish employee working at home made changes to his home network that accidentally allowed others to access information on his computer through an Internet search. Swedish policy prohibits keeping confidential information on home computers.

2007,Swedish Urology Group,WA,PORT,Other,"KOMO 4 News has learned a thief or thieves have stolen computer hard drives with personal files on hundreds of local patients.
  
  Police aren't saying much, but it appears to involve someone that has access to offices in the building.
  
  This week, Swedish Urology Group notified hundreds of patients and former patients about potential identity theft at its office in Seattle.
  
  ""I'm worried about my social security number and my credit rating,"" said one patient who wished to be identified by her first name, Kaye, out of privacy concerns.
  
  She got the letter yesterday.
  
  The Swedish Urology Group is one of dozens inside the Madison Medical Tower in the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle.
  
  In its letter to patients, the group says ""three external hard drives, which we use to back up our data, were stolen from our locked office suite.""
  
  ""Although we have security measures in place, the hard drives were taken as a result of an unforeseen intentional criminal activity.""
  
  Data Goes Back As Long As 3 or 4 Years
  
  Based on our contact with patients and former patients who got the notice, the stolen computer go back as long as 3 or 4 years.
  
  It's another example of how easily identity theft can happen, because in this case there's no sign of forced entry. The property management has sent notices to every office in the building, alerting them of the theft and urging them to make sure valuables are secured before the offices are closed for business.
  
  The Property Management company, CB Richard Ellis, sent the following statement to KOMO 4 News by email:
  
  ""We are very concerned anytime there is an incident involving a tenant on our property. We have very sound security procedures in place, and are constantly reevaluating them to ensure that the tenants' premises are secure. We are aware of one incident in which hard drives were taken from one particular tenant. We are cooperating with the local authorities and with that tenant to help solve this crime. We are unaware of any other incidents of theft other than a small amount of petty cash which was removed from an unlocked drawer. We highly value our tenants and have systems in place to communicate with them on a regular basis. ""
  
  No Suspects
  
  While no suspects have been observed, the fact that no one broke in raises suspicions that whoever took the hard drives may have had a master key.
  
  Because of the complexity of its hard drive technology, The Swedish Urology Group stresses the likelihood of patient information being retrieved is extremely low.
  
  The hard drives not only had patient information, but also contained information of the doctors and staff.
  
  Everyone who received the alert this week is advised to file a fraud alert with the credit reporting agencies.
  
  They should also closely monitor their credit reports and account statements, and keep this notice about the theft in a file in the event it's needed later. Seattle Police are investigating.
  
  Not Part Of Swedish Medical Center
  
  It's important to point out that Swedish Urology Group is an independent company. While it works with many doctors at Swedish Hospital, it is not a part of Swedish Medical Center.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

TALLAHASSEE B Spencer Larry Parson, 25, and Amber Sasha-Rashawn Simmons, 23, both of Tampa, were sentenced to 57 months in federal prison following their guilty pleas to conspiring to defraud the United States in the filing of false tax returns.  Parson and Simmons also pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud and two counts of aggravated identity theft in connection with the fraudulent tax refund scheme. The sentences were announced today by Pamela C. Marsh, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Florida.

At their plea hearing, the government’s factual basis stated that between 2011 and 2012, Parson and Simmons prepared and filed fraudulent returns seeking more than $818,000 in tax refunds.  Parson and Simmons created the fraudulent returns using taxpayer identification numbers and other personal identifying information stolen from both living and deceased individuals, who were patients of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. Parson was a former employee of the hospital

In addition to the 57 months in prison, the judge also imposed a special monetary assessment of $700, three years of supervised release and ordered Parson and Simmons to pay $283,591.33 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service.

 The Internal Revenue Service, United States Postal Inspection Service, and Leon County Sheriff’s Office investigated this case, which was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Coody.                                                                                                                                                  2.Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare officials modified policies to help better protect the privacy of patients’ personal information and offered identity protection services to more than 100 patients after learning last year that a hospital employee was suspected in a federal tax fraud scheme.

Spencer Larry Parson, 25, of Tallahassee, was indicted in U.S. District Court this week along with two Tampa residents on 31 counts of filing false tax returns, wire fraud, false claims and aggravated identity theft. The conspiracy included fraudulent claims totaling about $818,000.

Parson, who worked as a food service worker for TMH for three years, is accused of obtaining patient names and dates of birth from food tray receipts he delivered to their rooms in August 2011. Later, the indictment said, Parson used without permission his manager’s log-in to access the hospital’s computer system and get the patients’ Social Security numbers.

2014,Tampa General Hospital,FL,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"A settlement was recently reached for Tampa General Hospital, following allegations of a health data breach where employees inappropriately accessed patient information. The hospital will pay $10,000 into a Settlement Fund, where payments to Settlement Class Members will be for actual losses caused by fraudulent use of patient information, according to the settlement website. Tampa General will also pay for one year of credit monitoring to Settlement Class Members who successfully make a claim for monetary payment.  “The settlement provides that, to get a payment, you must have suffered an actual loss occurring after, and as a result of, a ‘stolen identity event’ that you reasonably believe is traceable to the matters described in a letter that you received from the Hospital (dated August 5, 2013, August 12, 2013, or September 12, 2014) notifying you that you may be at increased risk of identity theft as a result of inappropriate access to your patient information,” the website explains. The initial complaint alleged that patients provided PHI and PII to Tampa General, and that one or more former hospital employees “engaged in unauthorized or improper access to such PHI and PII.” Along with negligence, the hospital was accused of breach of fiduciary duty, breach of implied contract, and violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. “[Tampa General] denies the allegations of the Complaint and believes that the Action is without merit,” the settlement reads. “Nevertheless, in order to avoid the burden, expense, risk, and uncertainty of continuing to litigate the Action, and to put to rest the controversies engendered by the Action, and without any admission of any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever, [Tampa General] wishes to settle the Action and all Released Claims on the terms and' conditions set forth in this Agreement.” In May 2014, Tampa General reportedly had actual or constructive knowledge that unknown individuals wrongfully accessed and obtained patient PHI and PII, according to the amended complaint. This data included names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, admitting diagnoses, and insurers. The data breach was discovered when Tampa Police arrested an individual who was not employed at Tampa General but had hospital patient records in their possession. Plaintiffs claimed that the hospital’s failure to keep PHI and PII secure could lead to identity theft for the involved patients. Tampa General also had a history of failing to protect patient information, according to the complaint. The complaint cited a January 2012 incident where data integrity specialist Tigi Moore “accessed without authorization the personal information of present and/or former patients of Defendant for the purpose of engaging in a fraudulent scheme to steal the identities of patients and filing false tax returns on behalf of those patients.” Additionally, a University of South Florida employee was pulled over by Hillsborough County Sheriff’s deputies in May 2013. Upon searching the vehicle, deputies discovered PHI that the employee should not have had access to. There was also a June 2013 incident where a Tampa General nurse accessed patient records without authorization and discovered that the patient had given up a baby for adoption in October, 2008. “The nurse informed the family of this patient of this fact at a family reunion,” the claim said. “The nurse was terminated for this intrusion into the privacy of the patient.” In numerous cases, Tampa General’s only action to protect patient data was to send out letters to those affected by the breach which offered one year of free credit monitoring, according to the documents.

2014,Temple University Physicians,PA,Theft,Desktop Computer,"An unencrypted desktop computer containing personal information on 3,780 patients was stolen during a break-in at a Temple University physicians' office in late July, the university said in a statement Thursday.

The computer, in the department of surgery, contained files with patient information that could be used for identity theft, including name, age, billing codes, and, in some cases, the name of the referring physician. The files did not contain Social Security numbers or financial data, according to the university.

It said the theft was promptly reported to police, to appropriate authorities at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and to the affected patients.

""To help monitor the potential misuse of the stolen information, Temple has offered identity-monitoring services within the United States to all affected patients for 12 months, at no cost to them,"" the statement said. ""We deeply regret this incident and the inconvenience this may have caused our patients.""

Temple said it had taken steps to prevent such a theft in the future, including reeducating employees about precautions, increasing physical surveillance, and improving security measures for desktop computers.

The data breach was the second involving a health system reported in less than a month.

Community Health Systems, which includes 20 hospitals in Pennsylvania and one in South Jersey, said three weeks ago that personal data belonging to 4.5 million patients had been stolen between April and June by computer hackers traced to China.

Those records included patient names, addresses, birth dates, and telephone and Social Security numbers, but not credit-card or medical information, the Tennessee-based health system, one of the largest in the country, reported to the federal government.

That attack was believed to be the second largest of its type involving patient information since 2009, when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began tracking such breaches.

Last December, the University of Pennsylvania Health System announced that some patients' privacy was accidentally breached because of misprinted bills.

More than 500 erroneous statements, affecting more than 1,000 patients, were mailed out that month by one of Penn's billing vendors, RevSpring of Wixom, Mich., the university said. As a result, some patients received bills containing both their own correct information and an unrelated patient's information on the reverse side.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1.0,3780.0,378000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Letters From Texas Health Resources Hospitals Mailed to Wrong Recipients

IT Misconfiguration Leads to 15 Breach Reports
Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth is one of 15 hospitals reporting the same data breach.
A misconfigured billing system that caused a mailing mishap affecting nearly 83,000 individuals has prompted Texas Health Resources to file 15 breach reports to federal regulators - one for each hospital involved.

See Also: How Tri-Counties Regional Center Secures Sensitive Files and Maintains HIPAA Compliance

The healthcare system serves more than 7 million patients in North Texas through a physicians group and 26 hospital locations.

In a statement, Texas Health Resources says that on Aug. 23, it learned that a misconfiguration of its billing system ""allowed for patient information to be matched with and sent to the incorrect guarantor"" from about July 19 through Sept. 4.

""Texas Health immediately took steps to correct the misconfiguration and began an investigation,"" the statement says. ""The investigation determined that some billing information may have been mailed to someone other than the patient or their guarantor, which included patient name, account number, service date, name of treating physicians, name of health insurer, amount owed, and in some instances a short description of services rendered.""

Texas Health says it has not seen indication so far that any patient's information has been misused.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool website shows that on Oct. 22, Texas Health filed a breach report for each of the 15 hospitals impacted by the mishap, describing it as an ""unauthorized access/disclosure"" breach.

A total of nearly 83,000 individuals were affected by the Texas Health incident, according to the HHS website, which lists health data breaches affecting 500 or more individuals.

Impacted Facilities
The 15 hospitals impacted by the incident are:

Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth, 15,000 individuals affected;
Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 12,400;
Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Plano, 9,700;
Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest Fort Worth, 7,500;
Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Denton, 6,700;
Texas Health Arlington Memorial, 6,200;
Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Hurst-Euless-Bedford, 4,800;
Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Rockwall, 4,800;
Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Alliance, 3,800;
Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Allen, 3,000;
Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Cleburne, 2,700;
Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Kaufman, 2,200;
Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Azle, 2,100;
Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Stephenville, 1,300
Texas Health Harris Methodist Southlake, 500.
Same Breach, So Many Reports
So why didn't Texas Health just file one HIPAA breach report representing all its affected hospitals and patients?

""The decision on the number of breach reports to file is likely based on each incident needing to be acknowledged separately, especially if more than one guarantor is involved,"" notes Keith Fricke, principal consultant at tw-Security.

Privacy attorney David Holtzman of the security consultancy CynergisTek offers a similar assessment. ""It is not unusual for the components of a large health system to report separately a breach that had a common root cause or was the result of an incident at the hands of a business associate,"" he says.

""In this case, it appears that each of the facilities affiliated with Texas Health Resources was a covered entity required to submit its own report of an incident that occurred through managed billing services provided by the system's corporate parent.""

Similar Mishaps
Two of the five largest health data breaches added to the HHS HIPAA breach reporting website so far in 2019 have involved misconfigured IT.

In April, Puerto Rico-based clearinghouse and cloud services provider Inmediata Health Group reported a health data breach impacting nearly 1.6 million individuals involving a misconfigured IT setting that left protected health information viewable via internet search engines.

And a misconfigured database at UW Medicine in Washington state that left data on 974,000 patients exposed on the internet for several weeks.

As for mailing mishaps, one of the most scrutinized recent incidents involved insurer Aetna and a 2017 mailing of letters that exposed HIV-related information of 12,000 health plan members through the envelopes' clear window. That incident has resulted in Aetna settling a number of lawsuits that have cost the insurer more than $20 million.

Avoiding Problems
So how can organizations avoid breaches tied to IT misconfigurations?

""Changes made to technology settings, especially ones that impact processes involving access to or dissemination of patient information, should undergo more rigorous testing to validate the changes have not created any opportunity for unauthorized access,"" Fricke says. ""Quality control processes should catch these types of misconfigurations.""

Organizations must take precautions when designing the production and merging of patient contact information with a message containing information about the patient's health status or treatment, Holtzman notes.

""It is a best practice to develop a quality control checklist to help ensure that the development of the document or electronic communication can be produced in way that protects the confidentiality of the PHI,"" he says.

Any data processing in the production of the communication should be checked to ensure the output allows for any PHI to be kept confidential, he adds. A final quality assurance check to physically inspect the communication should also be made to confirm that the communication is going to the correct recipient and contains the PHI meant for that individual, Holtzman notes.

Texas Health did not immediately respond to an Information Security Media Group request for comment on the incident.

In its breach notification statement, it notes that to help prevent similar incidents, ""we are taking steps to further enhance the organization's data security procedures.""

Texas Health Resources said information was “matched with and sent to the incorrect guarantor,” which is often a health insurance policy’s primary holder.

Texas Health spokesman Stephen O’Brien said late Tuesday that about 82,000 patients had been affected.
The information sent to errant recipients included patient names, account numbers, service dates, the names of treating physicians, names of health insurers, amounts owed and, in some cases, short service descriptions.

Texas Health said it learned on Aug. 23 that a “misconfiguration” in its billing system led to the error at its wholly owned hospitals and at four joint ventures. The healthcare system said it was mailing letters to people whose information may have been routed improperly.

Most of the patients affected by the error had a procedure or services performed at Texas Health between about July 19 and Sept. 4.

No patient Social Security numbers, health insurance identification numbers or financial information were disclosed, Texas Health said.

The healthcare system said it was taking steps to improve its data security procedures and would correct the error that led to Tuesday’s disclosure.

There had been no indication that information had been misused, Texas Health said.

Texas Health released a list of the facilities that were affected: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Allen, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Denton, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital, Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Hurst Euless Bedford, Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Alliance, Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth, Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest Fort Worth, Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Cleburne, Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Azle, Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Stephenville, Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Kaufman, Texas Health Specialty Hospital Fort Worth, and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Plano.

There were also four Texas Health joint ventures affected: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Rockwall, Texas Health Center for Diagnostics and Surgery Plano, Texas Health Heart and Vascular Hospital Arlington and Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southlake.

2011,Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Azle,TX,Loss,Other,"Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital notifies almost 10,000 patients of a breach that occurred in April
JANUARY 29, 2011DISSENT
A recent update to HHS’s breach tool indicates that the Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital in Azle, Texas  reported a breach involving the PHI of 9,922 patients.

I did locate a breach notice on the hospital’s web site, although it was not immediately apparent from the home page, and I had to click on the “About Us” link on the home page to find a link to the breach notice.  The un-dated notice reads:

Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Azle is notifying our patients of a breach of unsecured patient health information. Texas Health Azle is under a duty imposed by Texas law to notify patients of breaches of patient information. The breach was confirmed on April 22, 2010 and would have impacted patients who were treated by the hospital’s lab from July 2008 through February 2010.

We want to emphasize that Texas Health Azle believes that there was never any potential harm of identity theft or financial fraud to you in any manner.

What type of information was involved?

A back-up computer disc containing laboratory chemistry exam results was missing from the lab. The back-up computer disc, such as the disc involved in this incident, contained the following information: patient’s name, patient’s date of birth, the date the test was run through the laboratory machine, the date blood was collected from the patient, the date results were reported by the laboratory machine, the abbreviated chemistry panel names (for example: sodium = Na; potassium = K) and the numerical result values (for example: sodium – 135 – 145 mEq/L).

What happened?

The sequence of events to determine the breach of patient privacy occurred as follows:

On April 22, 2010, the Texas Health Resources (Texas Health) compliance department and the Texas Health Azle compliance and privacy officer received notice that a back-up computer disc containing laboratory chemistry exam results was missing. A compliance and privacy investigation was immediately initiated.
It was determined that the computer disc contained laboratory chemistry results for the timeframe of July 2008 through February 2010.
The computer disc was stored in a file drawer in the main laboratory area. On April 7, 2010, laboratory personnel had determined that the computer disc was missing and a thorough search was initiated. The laboratory was completely searched as well as each employee’s locker but the disc was not located.
Each laboratory employee was interviewed by Human Resources and the Texas Health Azle privacy officer.
According to the investigation, it appears the computer disc was removed by a Texas Health Azle laboratory employee and information from the disc was sent to Texas Health. Once Texas Health began investigating the incident, a note was received stating the computer disc had been destroyed and that no information had been disclosed.
Using another Texas Health Azle hospital system, a report was generated to identify patients who had chemistry tests performed during the time period July 2008 through February 2010.
What steps are being taken by Texas Health Azle?

Texas Health conducted a thorough investigation into the incident. As a result of the investigation findings, corrective action was taken with several laboratory employees. Lab employees were re-educated on the Texas Health privacy policy and procedure, with a specific emphasis on reporting obligations and the chain of command when health information is missing. Employees were also coached on the importance of protecting patients’ information.

What steps can you take?

We want to emphasize that Texas Health believes that there was never any potential harm of identity theft or financial fraud to you in any way.

So why wasn’t this incident reported to HHS until January 2011?  And what does the hospital think the reason was that an employee took the disc and sent them the data?  Was the employee trying to make a point about inadequate security or was there some other reason?

And what evidence does the hospital have that the disc really was destroyed?",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,15.0,9922.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

On May 13, 2013, Texas Health Fort Worth learned that a portion of the microfiche we had provided to Shred-it for secure destruction services had been discovered in a park on May 11, 2013 by a local resident who immediately reported the incident to the Dallas Police Department and observed the microfiche until the police had arrived. In addition, three sheets of microfiche were found during that general time frame in two other public areas. Texas Health Fort Worth recovered the microfiche and began a thorough investigation. Our investigation determined that Shred-it had not destroyed the microfiche in accordance with our contract requirements.

The records on the microfiche may have included patient names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, clinical information, health insurance information and in some instances Social Security numbers. We have no knowledge that any of the information included on the microfiche has been accessed or used inappropriately. Furthermore, microfiche is no longer commonly used, and specialized equipment is needed to read the information it contains.

 The Brooklyn Hospital Center recently announced that 2,172 patients' medical information may have been exposed when a medical resident's backpack containing an unencrypted USB drive was stolen on December 2, 2013 (h/t DataBreaches.net)
 
 The USB drive held patient information for an authorized research project, though the fact that the drive was unencrypted was a violation of hospital policy.
 
 Data on the drive included limited medical information -- diagnoses and some lab values -- for cardiac disease and diabetes patients. The drive did not contain any financial information or Social Security numbers.

 The attack was discovered promptly, and steps were taken to limit the harm caused; however, it was not possible to prevent certain files from being encrypted.
 
 A third-party digital forensics firm was retained to assess the nature and extent of the malware attack and assist with the recovery of encrypted files. On September 4, following ‘exhaustive efforts’ to recover the encrypted files, it was determined that certain patient information was unrecoverable.
 
 Entire medical records have not been lost, but some patients’ dental and cardiac images could not be restored. The hospital is currently conducting a review to determine which patients have been affected and those individuals will be notified in due course. As is often the case with ransomware attacks such as this, the goal of the attackers appears to have been to extort money from the hospital rather than gain access to patient information. No reports of misuse of patient information have been received and the forensic investigation uncovered no evidence to suggest the attackers accessed or exfiltrated patient information.
 
 Brooklyn Hospital Center already had stringent security controls in place to prevent cyberattacks, although in this instance those controls were circumvented by the attackers. Policies, procedures, and existing security protocols are under review and security controls will be enhanced to prevent further breaches of this nature from occurring in the future.

 Hackers are demanding patients of Florida provider Richard Davis, MD pay a ransom to prevent the release of their personal information following a breach of the clinic's server.
 healthcare data breach extortion attempt hacker data theft
  By Jessica Davis
 
 January 10, 2020 - Current and former patients of Richard Davis, MD, who operates The Center for Facial Restoration, have received ransom demands from a cybercriminal who hacked the clinic's server.
 
 Other providers have reported extortion attempts after a breach in the past year, including CarePartners and plastic surgeon Robert Spies, MD. However, this is one of the first reported incidents where the hackers targeted the patients, rather than just the provider.
 
 In a letter to patients, Davis reportedly received a letter from hackers who claimed they had breached the clinic’s servers and obtained the complete medical records of patients, which could be used to publicly exploit patients or be traded to third parties.
 
 The hackers demanded a ransom payment from Davis and by November 29, about 15 to 20 patients reported to the clinic that they also received individual extortion attempts from the hackers “threatening the public release of their photos and personal information unless unspecified ransom demands are negotiated and met.”
 
 On November 12, Davis filed an FBI complaint and met with agents in an effort to examine the scope of the cyberattack and source of the ransom demands. While the investigation continues, patients receiving ransom demands are being encouraged to file individual complaints with the FBI.
 
 The hackers potentially stole the personally identifiable information from an estimated 3,500 former and current patients.
 
 The provider explained that PII is stored in a scan of the patient’s intake demographic questionnaire, rather than an electronic demographic database, which has made obtaining contact information for impacted patients “painstakingly slow and labor intensive.”
 
 What’s more, data access continues to be hindered by ongoing IT service disruptions, Davis explained. Patients are urged to share the notification with any known patients of The Center for Facial Restoration.
 
 Davis has since installed new hard drives, firewalls, and detection software to reduce the potential of future cyberattacks, “but no system is foolproof, and even the US government with all its resources has been victimized repeatedly.”
 
 “While upgrading my defenses clearly won’t help those individuals whose data has already been stolen, there is reason to suspect that the theft of patient photographs may be limited to only a very small number of individuals – mostly those patients who used email to send or receive their photographs – so the upgrades may prove useful,” Davis said.
 
 “I deeply regret that individuals currently or formally under my care have been victimized by this criminal act, and I urge you to monitor your financial information closely,” he added. “I am sickened by this unlawful and self-serving intrusion, and I am truly very sorry for your involvement in this senseless and malicious act.”
 
 The hack mirrors past security incidents of the notorious hacker known as thedarkoverlord, an anonymous hacking group that targeted a wide range of organizations – including the Athens Orthopedic Clinic in Georgia.
 
 One known member of the group is currently standing trial in St. Louis for his role in the hacking efforts, including aggravated identity theft and conspiring to commit computer fraud offenses.

  *** Public Notice Of Security Breach At Dayton Children’s
  Published: Friday, June 18, 2010 @ 11:19 AM
  Updated: Friday, June 18, 2010 @ 4:11 PM
  By: www.whiotv.com
  
  On May 21, 2010, Children’s Medical Center of Dayton was alerted that a mailing list containing 1001 patient names and addresses was improperly disclosed to another health organization.
  
  DAYTON, OHIO — An investigation was launched and there is no indication the information has been misused in any way and Dayton Children’s has notified each of the patients or their guardians by letter.
  
  After a thorough investigation, Dayton Children’s confirmed that an unencrypted list of patient names and addresses was sent via e-mail from the hospital to a local not-for-profit agency for use in a summer camp mailing. The list contained the names and addresses of patients who were treated in two clinics during a 15-month period.
  
  The information that was released did not contain any social security numbers, specific patient medical information, credit card or financial information or telephone numbers.
  
  The investigation revealed that the breach was due to a human error and the information was not taken with criminal intent.
  
  Dayton Children’s has confirmed that the list, which has been destroyed, was used for the exclusive purpose of inviting those listed to attend a summer camp; and the information was not shared or distributed to any other third-parties. As a result of this situation, Dayton Children’s has strengthened employee training on securing and protecting patient information.
  
  “This is deeply distressing to us at Dayton Children’s because we take patient confidentiality very seriously and we will do everything we can to protect patient information,” David Kinsaul, the president and CEO of Dayton Children’s, wrote in the letter to those affected.
  Dayton Children’s is committed to maintaining health information in a secure and confidential manner in accordance with federal and state law, and we regret that these standards were not met in this instance.
  
  The notification of the families, the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the general public through this news release and a posting on the hospital’s website are made pursuant to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act approved in 2009.

2015,The Johns Hopkins Hospital,MD,Theft,Laptop,"A physician from Johns Hopkins Medicine is reported to have had a suitcase stolen at an airport on August 10, 2015. In that suitcase was the physician’s laptop computer, which contained a limited amount of data relating to patients and research subjects. The laptop was unencrypted, therefore the theft potentially exposed the PHI of a number of individuals, although it is probable that the theft was an opportunistic crime, rather than the physician being targeted by a thief seeking medical data and Social Security numbers.
 
 In this case, the laptop did not contain highly sensitive information such as Social Security numbers and financial information, although patients did have a limited amount of their PHI exposed. The data stored on the laptop related to 571 patients who had received treatment for cancer between 2006 and 2014. Data relating to a research study on a rare genetic disorder were also potentially exposed.
 
 Patient data included names, treatment dates, physicians’ names, medical record numbers and a one to 3- word diagnosis of their condition. Patients who had participated in the research study had slightly more data exposed, including their names, dates of birth, addresses, study identification numbers, referring physicians’ names, comments and technical descriptions of their condition.
 
 According to the breach notice issued by the healthcare provider, it is hospital policy to encrypt and password protect all laptop computers to prevent the accidental disclosure of patient PHI, although in this case the laptop had not been encrypted. It is not clear whether the device was protected with a password.
 
 Policies can be put in place to protect patient privacy, but those policies must be put into procedures that are strictly followed. In response to this incident, Johns Hopkins is taking steps to address the matter and ensure that all laptop computers used by its physicians have their data encrypted to prevent future breaches of patient PHI.
 
 All patients affected by the breach have now been notified of the potential exposure of their PHI in accordance with HIPAA Rules.
 
 UPDATE: November, 5. 2015
 
 According to a recent report posted in the Baltimore Business Journal, the missing computer has now been returned to Johns Hopkins Hospital. An forensic analysis is now being conducted to determine whether any PHI was viewed during the period that the device was missing.

2017,The Lowell General Hospital,MA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"Lowell General Hospital in Massachusetts has discovered the medical records of 769 patients have been accessed by an employee without any legitimate work reason for doing so.
 
 By accessing the medical records, the employee breached hospital policies and violated the privacy of patients. Upon discovery of the breach, and completion of the subsequent investigation, the employee was terminated. Lowell General Hospital was satisfied that only one person was involved, and that this was not a widespread problem at the hospital.
 
 Patients impacted by the security incident have been notified and a breach notice has been placed on the hospital website. Patients have been informed that the types of information accessed by the former employee included names, dates of birth, medical diagnoses, and information relating to treatments provided to patients.
 
 No financial information, health insurance details, or Social Security numbers were viewed by the employee, and the investigation uncovered no evidence to suggest that any of the information that was accessed has been misused.
 
 Lowell General Hospital provides training to all staff members, and clearly instructs employees that the accessing of medical records without a legitimate reason is strictly prohibited. While checks are performed to ensure that employees are abiding by hospital policies, the incident has prompted Lowell General Hospital to conduct a review of its privacy and security policies relating to its medical record system. Improvements will be made to ensure that any future instances of snooping are identified rapidly. The hospital will continue to provide ongoing training to staff on patient privacy.
 
 What is not clear is how long the employee was able to improperly access medical records before the privacy violations were discovered. The number of patients impacted by the incident suggests the improper access had been ongoing for several months.
 
 HIPAA required covered entities and their business associates to regularly monitor PHI access logs for unauthorized access. While “regularly” is open to interpretation, it is a good best practice to conduct ongoing audits of access logs to help identify unauthorized activity.
 
 These audits can be conducted manually, although tools are available to reduce the administrative burden. Those tools are either rule-based or behavior-based. The former requires rules to be set which will trigger alerts if they are violated, while behavior based systems learn about normal access and trigger alerts if any anomalies are detected. These automated solutions can help to detect improper activity much more quickly, allowing rapid action to be taken when employees snoop on medical records.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,769.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 “Although to date it has been unable to locate the missing backup data tapes, McLean has no reason to believe that any of the information on the backup data tapes has been accessed or used inappropriately,” the hospital said in a statement. “It would take specialized software, equipment, and technical expertise in order to access the information on the tapes.”
 
 No patient information was breached, the hospital said. It said it reported the incident to the attorney general’s office Tuesday and has started sending letters to the people affected.
 
 McLean said it waited two months to report the incident because it was investigating the incident.
 
 “We needed to do a full investigation about exactly what was contained on the tapes,” spokeswoman Adriana Bobinchock said. “It took time to determine the scope of the incident and determine all the individuals who may have been affected.”

 patients of a breach of personal protected health information. The breach involves the
 theft of computer equipment from The Medical Center’s Mammography Suite containing
 information on patients who underwent bone density testing at The Medical Center
 between 1997 and 2009. We have no reason at this point to believe the device was stolen
 for the information on it or that any personal information has been released or used.
 On April 1, 2010, we discovered that a piece of computer equipment had been stolen
 from The Medical Center Mammography Suite. Upon learning of the theft, we
 immediately conducted a comprehensive investigation of the incident, and the theft has
 been reported to the Bowling Green Police Department.
 We have determined the information on the device included each patient’s full name, date
 of birth, address, medical record number and physician name. Some patients’ records
 also included information such as social security numbers, weight, height, and
 menopause age. The information on the hard drive was not encrypted; however, the hard
 drive was maintained in a locked, non-public, private area.
 The Medical Center has stringent policies and procedures in place to protect patient
 information and takes very seriously its obligation to safeguard the personal health
 information of its patients. As a result of this breach, steps are underway to further
 strengthen the security of patient information. We will now archive data to a secure
 network, which will allow us to eliminate the need for use of a hard drive like the one
 that was stolen. Additionally, we will ensure that we do not have any other equipment
 configurations that utilize a portable hard drive containing non-encrypted data.
 We regret the incident, and we are committed to prevent future such occurrences.
 However, affected patients are strongly encouraged to take the following steps
 recommended by the Federal Trade Commission to prevent any possible misuse of
 personal information. 
 • Monitor accounts and bank statements each month and check credit report on a
 regular basis.
 • Stay alert for the signs of identity theft, like:
 o accounts you didn’t open and debts on your accounts that you can’t
 explain.
 o fraudulent or inaccurate information on your credit reports, including
 accounts and personal information, like your Social Security number,
 address(es), name or initials, and employers.
 o failing to receive bills or other mail. Follow up with creditors if your bills
 don’t arrive on time. A missing bill could mean an identity thief has taken
 over your account and changed your billing address to cover his tracks.
 o receiving credit cards that you didn’t apply for.
 o being denied credit or being offered less favorable credit terms, like a high
 interest rate, for no apparent reason.
 o getting calls or letters from debt collectors or businesses about
 merchandise or services you didn’t buy.

 An investigation was immediately launched and third-party computer forensics experts were called in to determine the extent of the breach and whether any patient information had been accessed or copied by the attacker. The investigation revealed two email accounts had been compromised as a result of employees responding to phishing emails.
 
 It took until August 7, 2019 for the forensic investigators to determine that a breach had occurred and patient information had been compromised. One of the compromised email accounts was discovered to have been accessed by an unauthorized individual from March 13, 2019 to June 12, 2019, and the second account was subjected to unauthorized access on June 12, 2019 and from July 1 to July 8.
 
 As is typical in forensic investigations, it was not possible to determine whether the attacker viewed or copied patient information contained in emails and email attachments, but it was also not possible to rule out the possibility. At the time of issuing breach notification letters in October, no reports had been received to suggest patient information had been misused.
 
 The types of information potentially compromised in the phishing attacks varied from patient to patient. In addition to patient names, the following information may have been compromised: Address, date of birth, Social Security number, driver’s license number, state ID number, passport number, medical record number, CSN number, HAR number, Medicare number, Medicaid number, diagnosis information, treatment information, health insurance subscriber, group, and/or plan number, group identification number, financial account number, payment card information, electronic signature, username and password.

As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE improved physical security by installing an exit alarm lock and surveillance camera, and implementing a policy and procedure requiring managers to monitor inappropriate use of the facility's rear exit. The CE also inventoried its ePHI systems and adopted and implemented policies and procedures for workstation security, encryption, security awareness and training, electronic devices, and media controls.

  NEW YORK, NY
  – July 11, 2011 /Press Release/ ––
  
  Mount Sinai Multispecialty Physicians Practice announced today that two laptop computers which may contain confidential patient information are missing from its offices in Long Island City, Queens. An investigation has been launched, and there is no reason at this time to believe that any data on the missing laptops have been accessed or used improperly.
  
  Information about as many as 720 patients may be contained on the missing laptops, including protected health information such as name, social security number and diagnosis. One laptop was password protected, but a person with sophisticated computer abilities might be able to bypass the password protection.
  
  To ensure there is no recurrence, all computers in the Practice have been physically secured and the hard drives that contain confidential information have been encrypted. Mount Sinai has also reported this matter to potentially affected patients and to the appropriate state and/or federal agencies as required by applicable law. These patients have been advised to check their credit reports and to take appropriate precautions against possible identity theft.""",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0,712.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

2018,The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,TX,Theft,Paper/Films,"""UTHealth Media Release UTHealth Makes Public Notification of Incident Related to Patient Information HOUSTON – (Sept. 14, 2018) – The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) announced today an unauthorized disclosure of protected health information potentially affecting approximately 1,800 patients. The incident involved records of patients at five Houston area patient care facilities. The documents were in paper form and consisted of call sheets, rounding notes, medical record number stickers, and/or surgical schedules. Information included patients’ names, dates of birth, diagnoses, treatment, medication lists, vital signs and/or admission dates. No other identifying information was included. A recent graduate of a UTHealth medical residency program notified the UTHealth Privacy Office of the incident on July 24, 2018. He reported that his vehicle had been burglarized on July 17, 2018, and that patient records which were in the trunk of his locked vehicle had been stolen. We promptly took steps to investigate the circumstances of the disclosure, which revealed that the stolen documents had been discarded on a city street and found a day later by an employee of KHOU-TV Channel 11. We have no evidence that the patient information was used or viewed between the theft and the recovery. The KHOU employee who found the records then provided them to the news station, and a journalist began contacting the physician and some patients whose records had been disclosed. To properly safeguard the patients’ information, UTHealth and others involved made numerous requests to retrieve all of the patient records in KHOU’s possession. On Aug. 6, 2018, a representative of the news station returned the original documents to UTHealth. Since learning that KHOU made and retained copies of the information, UTHealth has asked repeatedly that the copies be returned or destroyed. We are grateful to the KHOU employee who found the documents, and we do not believe KHOU has disclosed any of the affected patients’ health information. We again respectfully request that KHOU return all copies of the records or destroy them without further compromising the privacy and dignity of the affected patients. We deeply regret that this situation has occurred, and we apologize to all affected patients. UTHealth and its health care partners are committed to providing quality care while safeguarding patients’ protected personal information. We remain steadfast in keeping and strengthening policies and procedures to protect patient privacy. We have reminded physicians to destroy documents when they are no longer needed, and we have repeatedly emphasized to physicians that they must ensure that patient information in their possession is secure at all times. We have also increased the visibility and accessibility of shredders in our facilities and asked our health care partners to do the same. Additionally, we are implementing measures to ensure that physicians discontinuing their affiliation with UTHealth and its affiliated health care partners either destroy or return any protected health information in their possession. Letters are being sent by the health care entities involved to their patients affected by the breach. Any patient who wishes to further protect their information in this case can contact KHOU Executive Producer Jennifer Cobb, and request that the news organization destroy any of their information that KHOU has retained. Her telephone number is 713-284-1087, and the address is KHOU11 News, 4343 Elgin St., Houston, TX, 77004.

She is accused of fraudulent use and possession of identifying information, a third-degree felony that carries punishment of up to10 years in prison upon conviction.
 Anna Emmons, a prosecutor in the District Attorney's Public Integrity Section, said the investigation began after a Houston cancer patient was contacted by a New Jersey-based bank. The call concerned a March 31, 2008 application filed online for $10,000 in credit in the patient's name, although she had never applied for the credit.
 
 Emmons said e-mail and computer details from the application were traced back to Cloud-Equam. UT police determined that on March 29 she had accessed the patient's hospital application for treatment, which contained confidential identity information.
 
 An analysis of computers at the defendant's home revealed that they contained personal information on two other patients. MD Anderson records showed Cloud-Equam had accessed that data from their hospital files in January.
 
 Emmons said this type of alleged identity theft is particularly difficult for consumers to prevent because they are required to reveal their personal information to receive services.
 
 ""They weren't careless,"" she said.
 
 Emmons said it is up to the requesting companies or institutions to ensure security.
 
 Had the bank not called about a minor matter on the credit application, the alleged identity theft may not have been discovered, Emmons said.
 
 M. D. Anderson issued the following statement:
 
 ""M. D. Anderson is currently assisting in the investigation of a former employee who, we have reason to believe, used the personal information of three patients to attempt to open lines of credit. We are actively working with the University of Texas Police Department and the Harris County District Attorney's Office to investigate and resolve this matter.
 M. D. Anderson terminated this person's employment and we contacted the three impacted individuals personally to assist them. Because this former employee had access to patient information in the normal course of her job responsibilities, we are also notifying any potentially impacted patients. To help safeguard against harm to their credit, we will offer these patients free credit monitoring for 12 months.
 M. D. Anderson takes seriously its responsibility to protect patients' medical and personal privacy, and will continue to work closely with authorities on this matter.""

2016,The Outer Banks Hospital,NC,Loss,Other,"OBX Hospital Warns About Data Privacy Breach
  August 22, 2016 By Prilock SecurityPosted in Cyber Security
 The Outer Banks Hospital is providing notice of a recent data event that may have compromised the security of personal information relating to current and former patients who received treatment at the OBX Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation program of Eastern Carolina Cardiovascular, P.A., located in Kitty Hawk, NC, from 2004 until June of 2016.
 
 The Outer Banks Hospital recently acquired certain assets of the OBX Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation program of Eastern Carolina Cardiovascular, P.A. We moved those assets on June 20-21 to The Outer Banks Hospital. On June 22, 2016, we discovered that two flash drives containing patient information went missing. We immediately began working diligently to investigate and to mitigate the potential impact of this incident to determine whether any sensitive information was affected.
 
 While there is no indication the information has been misused, we determined that current and former patient information was located on one or both of the flash drives, and we are providing written notice to those individuals for whom we have contact information. The flash drives may have contained the following categories of information: Social Security number, emergency contact number, mental health information, insurance ID number, diagnosis, health history information, patient account number, medical record number, referring physician name, and demographic information.
 
 “This is not consistent with our privacy practices, and we are truly sorry that it occurred,” said Ronnie Sloan, president of The Outer Banks Hospital. “Be assured that we do have policies and procedures in place to allow for appropriate action in response to the inappropriate use, access, or disclosure of our patient’s medical information, and that we have taken steps to address this matter.”
 
 As part of The Outer Banks Hospital’s commitment to the security of personal information, third-party forensic investigators have been brought in to help investigate the incident and the hospital began notifying affected patients by mail on Tuesday, August 16, 2016. As the investigation into potentially affected patients continues, the hospital expects to identify and send letters to the remaining patients whose addresses are on file within the next few weeks. As an additional precaution, The Outer Banks Hospital is offering affected individuals access to one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services.
 
 The Outer Banks Hospital has established a dedicated assistance line for individuals to ask questions or learn additional information regarding this incident. Individuals can reach this assistance line by calling the number 1-866-775-4209. If you believe you may have been affected, but did not receive a letter, please contact this assistance line.

2012,The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,TX,PORT,Other,"The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights has announced its fourth largest HIPAA violation penalty has been issued to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson). MD Anderson has been ordered to pay $4,348,000 in civil monetary penalties to resolve the HIPAA violations related to three data breaches experienced in 2012 and 2013.
 
 MD Anderson is an academic institution and a cancer treatment and research center based at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, TX. Following the submission of three breach reports in 2012 and 2013, OCR launched an investigation to determine whether the breaches were caused as a result of MD Anderson having failed to comply with HIPAA Rules.
 
 The breaches in question were the theft of an unencrypted laptop computer from the home of an MD Anderson employee and the loss of two unencrypted USB thumb drives, each of which contained the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of its patients. In total, the PHI of 34,883 patients was exposed and could potentially have been viewed by unauthorized individuals.
 
 The investigation revealed that MD Anderson had conducted a risk analysis, as is required by HIPAA. That risk analysis revealed the use of unencrypted devices posed a serious threat to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. To address the risk, in 2006 MD Anderson developed policies that required all portable storage devices to be encrypted.
 
 However, even though policies called for the use of encryption, encryption was not implemented until March 24, 2011. When encryption was implemented, it was not implemented on all portable devices in its inventory. MD Anderson reported to OCR that by January 25, 2013, it had only encrypted 98% of its computers. If MD Anderson had implemented encryption on all portable electronic devices containing ePHI, the three breaches would have been prevented.
 
 Preventable Data Breaches Experienced by MD Anderson
 The laptop was stolen from the home of Dr. Randall Millikan on April 30, 2012. Dr. Millikan confirmed that the ePHI on the device were not encrypted, the laptop was not password protected, and the ePHI could potentially have been viewed by family members at his home as a result, as well as by the individual who stole the laptop.
 
 The USB devices were lost on or around July 12, 2012 and December 2, 2013. The first contained an Excel file containing the ePHI of 2,264 individuals. The device was lost by a summer intern on her way home from work. The second USB drive was lost by a visiting researcher from Brazil at some point over the Thanksgiving weekend. The device was usually left in the tray on her desk. Neither device was encrypted or password protected.
 
 Between 2010 and 2011, MD Anderson’s Information Security Program and Annual Reports stated clearly that the storage of ePHI on mobile media was a key risk area that had not yet been mitigated, which was also detailed in its risk analysis for fiscal year 2011. That risk analysis determined that employees were downloading ePHI onto portable storage devices for use outside the institution. The failure to address the risk was a violation of 45 C.F.R. § 164.312(a)(2)(iv) and its own policies.
 
 Penalties for HIPAA Violations
 When financial penalties are deemed appropriate, OCR usually negotiates with the covered entity and a settlement is agreed; however, MD Anderson disagreed with OCR’s decision and maintained the financial penalty was unreasonable. Specifically, MD Anderson claimed that it was not obligated to use encryption as the data on the devices were used for research purposes, and that the research was not subject to HIPAA’s nondisclosure requirements. A covered entity has the right to contest penalties for HIPAA violations. Consequently, the matter was referred to an Administrative Law Judge.
 
 OCR proposed penalties for HIPAA violations under the tier of ‘reasonable cause’. OCR wrote in its Notice of Proposed Determination, “Reasonable cause is “an act or omission in which a covered entity or business associate knew, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that the act or omission violated an administrative simplification provision, but in which the covered entity or business associate did not act with willful neglect.”
 
 The penalty amounts in such cases are a minimum of $1,000 for each violation up to a maximum of $1.5 million per calendar year.
 
  
 
 
 
 OCR determined penalties were appropriate for calendar year 2011 (283 days from March 24 to December 31), calendar year 2012 (366 days from January 1 to December 31) and calendar year 2013 (25 days from January 1 to January 25), and applied the maximum penalty of $1.5 million for each of those calendar years.
 
 Administrative Law Judge Steven T. Kessell granted summary judgement in favor of OCR to remedy MD Anderson’s noncompliance with 45 C.F.R. § 164.312(a) – Technical Safeguards; encryption – and 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(a) – Uses and Disclosure of PHI; impermissible disclosure of ePHI.
 
 “OCR is serious about protecting health information privacy and will pursue litigation, if necessary, to hold entities responsible for HIPAA violations,” said OCR Director Roger Severino. “We are pleased that the judge upheld our imposition of penalties because it underscores the risks entities take if they fail to implement effective safeguards, such as data encryption, when required to protect sensitive patient information.”",1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1.0,34883.0,0.0,1.0,4348000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2013,The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,TX,Theft,Laptop,"8 DIGITAL HEALTH LEGAL
 Introduction
 At the most basic level, MD Anderson
 v. OCR underscores the OCR’s hardline
 approach to data breaches arising from
 loss or theft of unencrypted devices. As
 noted in Table I, fines and demands for
 corrective action are the rule, not the
 exception, following any significant data
 breach involving unencrypted devices.
 In its decision, the ALJ was sharply
 critical of MD Anderson’s attempt to
 excuse the lack of encryption, stating:
 “What is most striking about this case
 is that Respondent knew for more than
 five years that its patients’ [electronic
 protected health information (‘ePHI’)] was
 vulnerable to loss and theft and yet, it
 consistently failed to implement the very
 measures that it had identified as being
 necessary to protect that information.
 Respondent’s dilatory conduct is shocking
 given the high risk to its patients resulting
 from unauthorized disclosure of ePHI, a
 risk that MD Anderson not only recognized
 but that it restated many times.”
 This proceeding is very notable
 procedurally and one that covered entities
 and business associates under HIPAA
 will want to follow closely if MD Anderson
 appeals. MD Anderson likely chose to
 contest the proposed action in order to
 set up an eventual appeal to the federal
 district court on key questions concerning:
 • the ‘addressable’ security control of
 encryption set forth in the Rules;
 • whether the theft or loss of a
 device, without evidence that a
 third party actually accessed or
 acquired the data stored on the
 device constitutes an unlawful
 ‘disclosure’ under the rule; and
 • the reasonableness of the
 formulas the OCR applies to
 calculate civil money penalties.
 The case highlights OCR’s unwavering
 approach to a covered entity’s
 failure to encrypt ePHI on devices,
 notwithstanding the technical legal
 challenges under the wording of
 HIPAA or the Rules, and potentially
 sets up a legal battle in federal court.
 Background
 MD Anderson is both an academic
 institution and a cancer treatment and
 research centre located at the Texas
 Medical Center in Houston, Texas.
 MD Anderson is a covered entity
 under HIPAA and creates, maintains,
 receives and transmits ePHI related
 to its patients who receive health
 care services from MD Anderson.
 MD Anderson submitted breach
 notification reports to the OCR in 2012
 and 2013 in connection with three
 separate breach incidents afecting
 a total of 34,883 individuals. The first
 breach occurred on 30 April 2012 when
 an MD Anderson employee reported
 the theft of his laptop computer from his
 personal residence. The laptop was not
 encrypted or password-protected and
 contained the ePHI for 29,021 individuals.
 The second breach occurred on 13
 July 2012 and involved the loss of a
 USB thumb drive by an MD Anderson
 intern containing the ePHI for 2,264
 individuals. The third breach occurred
 on 2 December 2013, involving the loss
 of an unencrypted USB thumb drive
 containing the ePHI for 3,598 individuals.
 Between October 2015 and August
 2016, MD Anderson and the OCR
 attempted to reach a resolution on the
 matter, but this proved unsuccessful.
 On 24 March 2017, the OCR issued
 a notice of proposed determination
 suggesting that MD Anderson pay
 over $4.3 million in civil money
 penalties. MD Anderson subsequently
 requested an administrative hearing.
 ALJ opinion
 The OCR alleged that MD Anderson
 had failed to comply with the HIPAA
 regulatory requirements in two ways:
 • by failing to protect its ePHI by
 not performing its self-imposed
 duty to encrypt electronic devices
 and data storage equipment
 (§164.312 of the Rules); and
 • by allowing ePHI to be impermissibly
 disclosed (§164.502(a) of the Rules).
 The ALJ agreed with both assertions,
 rejecting MD Anderson’s arguments.
 The ALJ relied on MD Anderson’s well
 MD Anderson v. OCR: key takeaways
 On 1 June 2018, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (‘HHS’) Administrative Law Judge (‘ALJ’),
 Steven T. Kessel, ruled that The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (‘MD Anderson’) violated
 the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (‘HIPAA’) Privacy and Security Rules (45
 C.F.R. 164) (‘the Rules’), requiring MD Anderson to pay $4,348,000 in civil money penalties to the Ofce of
 Civil Rights (‘OCR’). The ALJ granted summary judgment in favour of the OCR on all issues and sustained the
 OCR’s imposition of civil money penalties against MD Anderson. Jennifer C. Archie and Marissa R. Boynton,

 A Cecile Park Media Publication | September 2018 9
 documented, long-standing security
 assessment that encryption of portable
 devices storing ePHI was an important
 and specifically selected means to
 mitigate risk of unauthorised disclosure.
 In addition, he highlighted that:
 • MD Anderson’s 2006 version of
 its Information Resources Security
 Operations Manual required that
 data stored on transportable media
 and laptops must be encrypted;
 • in 2008, MD Anderson announced
 that it intended to implement the
 first phase of a media security
 project which included implementing
 encryption of institutional laptop
 and desktop computers;
 • in 2009, MD Anderson put laptop
 encryption eforts on hold due to
 financial constraints. As of then, it
 had not encrypted any of its laptops.
 In 2010, MD Anderson’s director
 of information security proposed
 restarting eforts to encrypt laptops
 in light of the theft of a laptop and
 other instances of lost records; and
 • as of November 2013, following
 the three breaches reported to
 the OCR, more than 4,400 MD
 Anderson computers were not
 encrypted, and as of January 2014
 more than 2,600 MD Anderson
 computers were not encrypted.
 MD Anderson argued that it was not
 required to encrypt its devices as
 Section 164.312(a)(2)(iv) of the Rules
 only requires covered entities to
 “implement a mechanism to encrypt
 and decrypt electronic protected
 health information.” Under the Rules,
 encryption is an ‘addressable’ security
 standard, which means that MD
 Anderson could theoretically have
 attempted to document and justify an
 alternative security mechanism that
 was equivalent to encryption, including
 on grounds of expense or burden.
 Here, however, it seems that for many
 years MD Anderson had selected
 encryption as its preferred mechanism
 and had not documented an efective
 implementation of alternative means.
 Covered entities put themselves at risk
 when they decide to use addressable
 controls for encryption. Furthermore,
 MD Anderson was unsuccessful in its
 argument that it had implemented a
 legally adequate “mechanism” by:
 • requiring confidential data and ePHI
 stored on portable computing devices
 be encrypted and backed up;
 • employing password protection; and
 • providing annual employee training
 regarding securing and protecting
 ePHI.
 While the ALJ agreed that risks can be
 mitigated through mechanisms other
 than encryption, it found that a covered
 entity must adopt a mechanism that is
 efective at protecting its ePHI, which
 MD Anderson had failed to do in his
 opinion. Whenever the root cause of
 an unauthorised disclosure of ePHI
 is the loss of an unencrypted device,
 the covered entity will have a very
 hard time prevailing on the argument
 that these alternative methods were
 equivalent, reasonable and appropriate.
 MD Anderson further argued
 that it did not violate §164.502(a)
 of the Rules because:
 • the loss of ePHI from the stolen
 laptop and lost thumb drives was
 not a ‘disclosure’ as defined by the
 Rules absent factual evidence that
 an unauthorised person viewed
 the data (as opposed to being in
 mere possession of the devices);
 • the ePHI contained in the stolen
 and lost devices was research
 information that is outside the scope
 of HIPAA and the Rules; and
 • unsanctioned activities by its
 employees and by the person
 who stole the laptop cannot be
 imputed to MD Anderson.
 The ALJ rejected all three arguments.
 While the absence of evidence that
 bad actors had access to the data can
 sometimes support an argument that
 the data subjects were not harmed by
 the loss of security, the ALJ disagreed
 that such proof was needed in order
 to conclude the ePHI was ‘disclosed.’
 The ALJ also dismissed MD Anderson’s
 argument that the lost or stolen ePHI
 was research information and therefore
 outside the scope of HIPAA and the
 Rules. MD Anderson tried to rely
 on language in the Rules’ preamble
 regarding research, however, the ALJ
 determined that such language was
 meant to apply to research conducted
 by non-covered entities. Lastly, the
 ALJ rejected MD Anderson’s argument
 that it could not be held liable since its
 employees who lost the thumb drives
 were not acting within the scope of
 their authorised duties, and the thief
 who stole the laptop was not an agent
 or employee of MD Anderson. The
 ALJ clarified that while MD Anderson’s
 employees contravened the company’s
 policies concerning protection of ePHI,
 this does not mean that their actions
 were outside the scope of their ofcial
 duties. With regard to the stolen
 laptop, the ALJ made clear that the
 gravamen of the case is not the theft
 itself but the fact that MD Anderson
 failed to protect ePHI from disclosure.
 MD Anderson also made several
 arguments against the penalty requests
 submitted by the OCR, all of which
 were rejected by the ALJ. The OCR
 determined that MD Anderson’s
 violations qualified them for the second
 tier of penalty ranges, namely violations
 that “are due to reasonable cause
 and not due to willful neglect.” MD
 Anderson attempted to argue that, to
 the extent that any violation occurred, it
 should fall within the first tier of noncompliance which is for violations that
 “the covered entity did not know about
 or would not have known about by
 exercising reasonable due diligence.” MD
 Anderson’s argument turned on the fact
 that it could not have known that a thief
 would steal a laptop or that its employees
 would choose to use unencrypted
 USB drives for storage of confidential
 information and then lose those devices.
 While the ALJ acknowledged that MD
 Anderson could not foresee those acts,
 it dismissed the argument as irrelevant.
 The issue was whether MD Anderson
 was aware of the risk posed by storing
 unencrypted ePHI on mobile devices.
 The ALJ concluded definitively that
 MD Anderson was aware of this risk
 evidenced by, among other things, the
 fact that in 2008 it had ordered that all
 mobile devices be encrypted. The ALJ
 rejected MD Anderson’s attempts to

 continued
 turn the penalty question into an issue
 of whether the employees had abided
 by its policies. Whether or not they had
 abided by the policies does not change
 the fact that MD Anderson had failed to
 address the risk that it had identified,
 the potential for data loss due to the
 storage of ePHI on unencrypted devices.
 The OCR requested that the ALJ
 impose two penalties falling within the
 ranges permitted by the second tier:
 penalties of $2,000 per day for the
 period of 24 March 2011 to 25 January
 2013, to remedy MD Anderson’s failure
 to encrypt ePHI; and penalties of
 $1,500,000 per year for the years 2012
 and 2013, to remedy the loss of ePHI
 pertaining to approximately 31,000
 and 3,500 individuals respectively.
 The ALJ acknowledged that a penalty
 of $2,000 per day is reasonable given
 MD Anderson’s level of culpability, and
 that it is only a small fraction of the
 $50,000 per day penalty that is allowed
 for second tier penalties. Again, the
 ALJ noted that MD Anderson had failed
 to implement encryption on mobile
 devices for years after identifying the
 risk, and the unauthorised disclosure
 afected over 33,000 individuals. The
 ALJ rejected MD Anderson’s argument
 that, at most, it had committed three
 violations of regulatory requirements.
 In addition, it clarified that the violations
 did not result from the specific events
 resulting in the data breaches, but
 instead, from MD Anderson’s failure to
 protect the ePHI for several years.
 Furthermore, the ALJ held that a
 penalty of $1,500,000 per year for the
 years 2012 and 2013 was appropriate.
 The ALJ considered the loss of ePHI
 on a per capita basis to reflect the
 gravity of the loss. It also concluded
 that any mitigating factors cited by MD
 Anderson were taken into consideration,
 evidenced by the fact that $2,000
 per day is only 1/25th of the maximum
 allowable penalty, and the annual
 penalties of $1,500,000 come out to
 less than $90 for each violation.
 Takeaways for future cases
 Ultimately, MD Anderson v. OCR amounts
 to MD Anderson’s failure to encrypt
 portable devices after identifying
 the risk of loss or theft and deciding
 that encryption was the appropriate
 method for mitigating the risk. The
 ALJ repeated this point throughout
 its decision, sending a clear message
 to all covered entities: do not delay
 implementing measures to protect your
 ePHI once an area has been identified
 as high risk, and particularly, once you
 have decided how to address the risk.
 Also, speaking at the American Health
 Lawyers Association Annual Meeting on
 26 June 2018, Serena Mosely-Day, Acting
 Senior Advisor for HIPAA Compliance
 and Enforcement at the OCR, stated
 that MD Anderson v. OCR stands for the
 failure to manage an identified risk to
 prevent future impermissible disclosures.

2014,The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,TX,Loss,Other,"More than 3,500 patients of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center may have had personal information compromised after a researcher’s unencrypted USB thumb drive went missing.
 
 How many victims? 3,598, according to HHS.gov. 
 
 What type of personal information? Names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, diagnoses, and treatment and/or research information related to treatment of infections.
 
 What happened? A researcher lost a USB thumb drive that contained the patient information.
 
 What was the response? The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is reinforcing policies and procedures with regard to storing and handling personal information on electronic devices. Added security measures will allow USB thumb drives to be encrypted, as well as wiped remotely. All impacted patients are being notified.
 
 Details: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center first learned the USB thumb drive was missing on Dec. 2, 2013. The drive was last seen on Nov. 27, 2013, in the researcher’s access-controlled office. A search of the office and the researcher’s home was conducted, but the device was not found.
 
 Quote: “We have no reason to believe that the information on the USB thumb drive has been or will be accessed improperly, and it may be that the drive was simply misplaced within the facility or inadvertently discarded,” according to a notification on the website.

2018,The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,TX,Unauthorized Disclosure,Email,"Providers are not required to encrypt protected health information (PHI), but it's something they should consider. Not only does proper encryption spare a provider the hassle and embarrassment of reporting a breach, but it's getting harder for providers to defend the decision not to encrypt. And as the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center just discovered, a provider can expect no mercy when it has a written policy that calls for encryption and suffers a major breach because it failed to follow its own policy.
  
 A press release from the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) provides details about the summary judgement:
  
 ""A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) has ruled that The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules and granted summary judgment to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on all issues, requiring MD Anderson to pay $4,348,000 in civil money penalties to OCR. This is the second summary judgment victory in OCR’s history of HIPAA enforcement and the $4.3 million is the fourth largest amount ever awarded to OCR by an ALJ or secured in a settlement for HIPAA violations.""
  
 The ALJ's decision contains a breakdown of the civil money penalties levied against the center:
 $2,000 per day, for each day between March 24, 2011, and Jan. 25, 2013.
 $1,500,000 per year for the years 2012 and 2013.
 MD Anderson had three breach reports in 2012 and 2013 thanks to the theft of an unencrypted laptop from an employee's home and the loss of two unencrypted thumbdrives. Combined, the devices contained PHI for more than 33,500 people.
  
 When the OCR investigated, it discovered that MD Anderson had created written policies that called for encryption in 2006. In addition, the center had conducted a risk analysis and determined that the lack of encryption posed a high risk to the security of electronic PHI.
  
 To make matters worse: Despite the encryption policies and high risk findings, MD Anderson did not begin to adopt an enterprise-wide solution to implement encryption of ePHI until 2011, and even then it failed to encrypt its inventory of electronic devices containing ePHI between March 24, 2011, and Jan, 25, 2013.
  
 The multiple failures prompted a harsh ruling from the ALJ, who described MD Anderson's conduct after the breach as dilatory and shocking given the high risk to its patients and the fact that the center recognized the risk and restated it many times.
  
 And while it may seem hard to believe, MD Anderson reported another breach the day before the ALJ's ruling. The center reported an unauthorized access/disclosure breach via email that involved the PHI of 1,266 patients on May 31.
  
 A notice to patients on the center's website provides more details:
  
 On May 3, 2018, an MD Anderson employee sent an email seeking to recruit people for a research study involving people with a history of colon cancer. The employee meant to send the email in a manner that hid the email addresses of the recipients, but accidentally made the email addresses visible to the others who received the email. We were able to stop delivery on some of the emails, but approximately 599 people still received it. These people may have seen the email addresses to which the email was sent and, if they were able to identity anyone from their email address, may have assumed the person was an MD Anderson patient and had a history of colon cancer.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1.0,33500.0,0.0,1.0,4348000.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

We immediately shut down the employee’s email account and began an investigation. Our investigation determined an email in the account contained patient information, which may have included patients’ names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, and clinical information, such as diagnoses, treatment, physicians’ names and medications. Patients’ social security numbers and financial information, such as bank account or credit card information, were not included in the email account. This incident affected approximately 2300 UVM Medical Center patients.
 
 While we have no evidence that any of our patients’ information was ever used in any way, we began mailing letters to the affected patients on July 21, 2017, and established a dedicated call center to answer patients’ questions.

2012,Titus Regional Medical Center (TRMC),TX,INSD,Other,"A nurse has been fired by a Texas hospital after accessing information on patients for whom she had no clinical responsibility, according to the Mt. Pleasant, TX Daily Tribune. The hospital, Titus Regional Medical Center, reportedly discovered the unauthorized access in the course of an audit in November. The nurse admitted to looking at the records out of curiosity but insisted that no records had been further disclosed.
 
 The hospital decided to notify 108 patients in a letter which warned them of a slight risk of identity theft. The hospital administrator indicated that the notices may not be required under HIPAA but were being sent out of an abundance of caution, and emphasized that there was no evidence any data was printed nor disclosed to any third parties. Although most records accessed did not contain social security numbers, affected patients were nevertheless advised to contact the three major credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.
 
  
 
 This incident is reminiscent of the 2011 UCLA breach which resulted in a prison term for the snooping employee and similar incidents involving other California hospitals. A common element in these breach incidents is that the health information was not sold, distributed or otherwise further disclosed by the snooping employees. However, after an investigation, federal health regulators determined that UCLA employees reviewed patients’ electronic medical records ""repeatedly and without a permissible reason."" Ultimately, UCLA entered into a settlement agreement with federal health regulators, which among other things, socked UCLA with a fine of $865,000. 
 
  
 
 These cases illustrate the seriousness of HIPAA’s still poorly-defined “minimum necessary” standard which, at the least, requires workers at covered entities and business associates to have a valid reason beyond mere curiosity before they access PHI. The ease with which employees can call up any record in a health system’s database can present an overpowering temptation, and it is incumbent on employers to educate their workforce about the need to resist the urge to snoop.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,15.0,108.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 The inappropriate access was discovered during a routine audit of PHI access logs on August 25, 2017. The subsequent investigation revealed two individuals from the healthcare provider’s office had accessed the protected health information of patients, without any legitimate work reason for doing so.
 
 Access to patients PHI is necessary in order for independent health care providers to conduct their work duties, although in this case, the PHI of patients was accessed even though the patients were not being treated by the individuals.
 
 TJ Samson interviewed both individuals about the alleged unauthorized access and is satisfied that no further uses or disclosures of PHI have occurred.
 
 In response to the incident, TJ Samson has terminated access for the individuals in question. The breach notice posted to the TJ Samson website does not indicate any further action was taken against those individuals, although steps have been taken to prevent similar cases of unauthorized access, which included conducting a review of access procedures for independent health care providers. Individuals whose PHI was viewed have been notified of the breach of their confidential information by mail.
 
 The types of information accessed included names, medical information, demographic information, and in some cases, Social Security numbers and insurance information.

 The incident was detected rapidly, with third party forensic investigators brought in to investigate the breach. The investigation revealed the accounts were accessed on April 18 and April 19.
 
 The investigation revealed the email accounts contained the protected health information of some patients, including names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, insurance details and treatment and diagnostic information. The forensic investigation did not uncover evidence to suggest any patient information has been misused, although it was not possible to rule out the possibility that data were accessed by the attackers. Torrance Memorial Medical Center says the breach investigation is ongoing and the incident has been reported to the FBI.
 
 Since there is a risk that PHI was accessed, all affected individuals have been offered one year of credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services without charge.

 Hospital officials became suspicious earlier this year that a breach of patient privacy may have occurred on Facebook and launched an investigation but said that as yet it has found no evidence that patient names, photographs, or other information was posted on the site. Tri-City also has not specified the information these six employees allegedly shared on the website.
 
 Nevertheless, Larry Anderson, CEO of Tri-City released a statement saying the hospital will pursue termination of the employees who ""used social media to post their personal discussions concerning hospital patients."" Representatives from Tri-City have not released what positions the employees at the hospital hold, but Anderson said in the statement, ""we do not tolerate violation of our privacy policies.""
 
 A story in last week's North County Times quoted Max Carbuccia, a labor representative for the California Nurses Association, saying that six Tri-City nurses were put on administrative leave about three weeks ago. He said the nurses had not seen the evidence against them, and that all deny posting specific information about specific patients online.

 Some nursing organizations noted that the termination seems like inappropriate disciplinary action in light of these circumstances.
 
 ""I find it curious that the hospital would pursue termination if no HIPAA violations were made such as posting patient names or pictures,"" says Debi Savage, RN, MSN, BSN, CNO, of Sacred Heart Hospital in Chicago, IL. ""However, if the nurses have on their Facebook page the name of the hospital and possibly the unit they work on and then discuss 'hypothetical scenarios' that could be traced back to patients in that hospital and unit, then I believe this is inappropriate.""
 
 ""The article (reported by North County Times in CA) clearly states that the discussion on Facebook was hypothetical and didn't include patient information (thereby excluding a HIPPA violation), says Tonya Barrere. ""It sounds more like a blog where nurses can bounce their questions/ideas about disease processes or situations they encounter in their profession. In my opinion it's the nurses' rights who have been violated--not the patient's.""
 
 Savage does argue, however, that if she were in this situation, and the nurses only posted or shared information on the types of patients the nurses dealt with, she would not be concerned or terminate them.
 
 Carbuccia says the nurses may have responded to hypothetical questions on how to treat different types of patients.
 
 Lisette Cintron, RN, MSN, CHCQM, CNL, Clinical Nurse Educator/NICHE Program Co-Coordinator of Juniper, FL, says that many of these social networking sites are platforms where nurses ""gather together to discuss and obtain information on how to handle specific conditions, what options are available, and how to better help their patients.""
 
 However, Cintron believes that using Facebook to discuss this information may not be the best route for nurses to take. ""We are unsure exactly of what the nurses at Tri-City Medical Center shared on Facebook, but depending on what exactly was shared, should determine whether the firing of the nurses is justified.""
 
 Savage believes that based on this particular case, hospitals should expand their HIPAA policy to include posting patient information or hospital information on social media sites, whether that be on Facebook or one's personal blog.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 A former employee took logs from the Emergency Department of patients who had been admitted to the hospital or transferred to other facilities between Dec. 1, 2013 and May 13, 2014. The records included: patients’ names, dates of birth, admitting physician, medical record number, diagnosis and admit date and time. The records, however, did not include Social Security numbers or financial information.
 
 The records were on the lower shelf of a cart used to transport personal belongings from the former employee’s office, according to U-T San Diego. It was an accidental removal and the employee notified a member of Tri-City’s Governance Committee of the incident shortly after he discovered the files had been loaded into his vehicle, the U-T reported. The committee member advised the employee to turn the records over to the health department so it would not look like there was a cover up, according to the U-T.
 
 The hospital reported the incident to the police and notified patients who may be at risk, although there is no indication that the personal information has been used in any way so far.

The privacy breach was discovered in November 2016, and impacts 1,126 TriHealth patients.
 
 The glitch caused current addresses to be substituted with former addresses. In some cases, mail may have been forwarded on to the correct address, although TriHealth was unable to determine whether this was the case. Letters have now been mailed to the correct addresses and affected patients have been notified of the error by mail.
 
 The error affected mailings of billing statements, appointment reminder letters, and other correspondence between November 15, 2015 and January 12, 2017 when the error was discovered. Individuals affected by the error had all mailings directed to wrong addresses between those dates.
 
 The types of protected health information contained in the mailings varied from patient to patient. PHI that was potentially exposed was limited to patients’ names, visit dates, descriptions of medical service provided, places of service, financial charges, details of payments and adjustments, account balances, due payments, and details of appointments.
 
 No insurance numbers, Social Security numbers, credit/debit card information or financial institution information was printed in any of the misdirected letters.
 
 TriHealth has not received any reports to suggest any of the information contained in the letters has been misused in any way. Since the privacy breach only involved a limited amount of data, and the risk of misuse is believed to be low, affected individuals have not been offered credit monitoring or identity theft protection services.

 January 20, 2017
 
 In late November of 2016, TriHealth discovered a software glitch inadvertently replaced the current mailing addresses of 1,126 TriHealth patients with a previous address we had on file for them.

Since TriHealth is unable to determine if the billing statements and other correspondence reached patients at their current address, we are notifying affected patients of this incident.
 
 Billing statements, reminder letters and other correspondence sent out by TriHealth to those affected took place from November 15, 2015 through January 12, 2017. The mailings may have contained patient name, place of service, visit dates, descriptions of services, financial charges, payments and adjustments, balance and amount due or appointment reminders. The mailings did not contain patient social security number, credit card number or any other financial institution information.

2011,Trinity Medical Center (Montclair Baptist Medical Center),AL,PHYS,Other,"A woman was charged Thursday with stealing 4,500 patients' medical records from Trinity Medical Center, possibly with the intent of using them for identity theft.
 
 Chelsea Catherine Stewart, 26, was arrested Thursday morning by U.S. Postal inspectors, who acted after Alabaster police found hundreds of pages with names, birth dates and Social Security numbers at a house in Alabaster where Stewart was staying. The files spanned several years, including before 2006, when Trinity was still Montclair Baptist Medical Center.
 
 Trinity officials said surgery schedules were stolen from a closed patient registration area. The hospital planned to run an announcement of the data breach in today's edition of The Birmingham News and has also mailed letters to all affected patients.
 
 ""We take our responsibility to protect patient privacy very seriously and sincerely regret that this theft occurred,"" spokeswoman Leisha Harris said in an emailed statement. ""To help safeguard against any further incidents, we are increasing our document security and changing access to our registration areas.""
 
 Stewart was charged Thursday with violating the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which protects the privacy of medical records, and released on an unsecured bond of $5,000. She has not been indicted and did not have to enter a plea. She may face additional charges, said her court-appointed attorney, Scott Brower.
 
 According to the charging document, Stewart said she had taken the records from the hospital when visiting a patient there between March 22 and April 1. Albaster police found the paperwork April 8 at a house where Stewart was staying, postal inspector John Bailey said in an affidavit.
 
 Four days earlier, Stewart had been arrested by Alabaster police and charged with two counts of breaking into a vehicle and two counts of credit card fraud. Those cases are still pending in Shelby County District Court.
 
 In addition to the patient data, Bailey said there were handwritten notes with some people's personal information that could be used for identity theft, plus a sort of ""to do"" list for fraud.
 
 ""Get hospital records together and run credit reports on people to get info,"" the notes said, according to the affidavit.
 
 Harris said that Trinity doesn't believe the stolen information had been or would be used, but the hospital is offering free credit monitoring for affected patients.
 
 Stewart is scheduled for a court appearance June 10 at 10 a.m. before U.S. Magistrate Judge T. Michael Putnam.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,7.0,4500.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2011,Troy Regional Medical Center,AL,Unauthorized Disclosure,Paper/Films,"Troy Regional Medical Center (TRMC) has notified certain patients of a data theft incident involving unauthorized access and removal of some of their personal information. TRMC is conducting a comprehensive investigation into the incident and, based on information obtained to date, it appears the patients impacted by the incident were limited to individuals born between 1988 and 1992.
 
 The hospital has sent a letter to the approximately 880 patients affected recommending specific steps they should take to protect their personal information against harm and detailing the free identity protection resources being made available to them in response to the incident.
 
 TRMC learned on May 20, 2011, that certain data, including certain patients’ personal information, had been accessed and removed from the hospital without authorization and in direct violation of hospital policy in the early part of this year. The patient data accessed was limited to name, address, date of birth, social security number, and medical record number. Other medical information, such as the patient’s treatment or diagnosis, was not included.
 
 Law enforcement officials have initiated a criminal investigation into the matter. TMRC is not a target of that investigation and the hospital is cooperating, and will continue to cooperate, with investigators. In addition, the hospital has conducted its own internal investigation and has already implemented a number of steps to reinforce hospital safeguards and procedures. The hospital has also made arrangements to provide immediate, mandatory training to all employees regarding protection of patient information.
 
 Law enforcement officials have communicated that some of the personal information removed from the hospital may have been used to file fraudulent income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Law enforcement has advised that other healthcare providers in Georgia and Alabama have also been targeted by the perpetrators.
 
 “We greatly regret this incident and we are committed to protecting our patients’ information and to providing assistance to protect the personal information of the patients affected,” said TRMC Chief Executive Officer and Administrator Teresa Grimes. “In addition to expressing our sincere regret for this incident, we are making free identity protection resources available to affected patients at no charge and providing a toll-free number they can call with questions or concerns.”
 
 TRMC is providing identity protection resources to those affected at no expense for a period of one year. Affected patients have been sent information by U.S. mail with details regarding how to activate their protection, which is being provided by Experian through its ProtectMyID product.
 
 To determine whether a fraudulent income tax return may have been filed and invoke other protections that may be available from the IRS and other agencies, affected patients may also contact the IRS toll free at (800) 908-4490 or in person at 1285 Carmichael Way, Montgomery, Alabama 36106 and contact the Federal Trade Commission toll free at (877) 438-4338 or online at www.consumer.gov/idtheft.
 
 Any individual who may have information about this incident is encouraged to please contact the hospital toll free at (800) 457-5173. Information may be communicated anonymously.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,100.0,880.0,88000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2015,"Truman Medical Center, Incorporated",MO,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"An employee of the covered entity (CE), Truman Medical Center, found a list of patients on the internet. The list contained names, addresses, and internal identification numbers for 503 of the CE's patients. The CE determined that the list was posted to a file transfer protocol (FTP) site by the public relations department and was a mailing list used to notify patients that a clinic was moving to a new location. The list was available on the internet from September 2012 until March 2015. The CE provided breach notification to HHS, affected individuals and the media, and provided substitute notice on its website. Following the breach, the CE immediately removed and deleted the patient list from FTP site and reviewed the other information posted on the site. The CE improved safeguards by enabling the public relations employees to send encrypted emails and providing instructions on how to use secure email. The CE also required additional training for workforce members in the public relations department. OCR obtained written assurances that the CE implemented the corrective actions listed above.

2019,"Truman Medical Center, Incorporated",MO,Theft,Laptop,"For the second time in four months, Truman Medical Centers has suffered a data breach, this one involving more than 114,000 patients.
 
 The Kansas City safety net hospital informed the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights that the cause of the breach was a laptop theft on Dec. 5.
 
 Leslie Carto, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said the work-issued laptop was stolen from an employee’s vehicle.
 
 The computer was password-protected, Carto said, and “there’s no evidence that any unauthorized party accessed, viewed or misused the information.”
 
 “While we think the odds of the thief being able to crack the password and find any PHI (protected health information) are slim, we owe it to our patients to let them know about the theft,” Carto said. 
 
 Truman is offering credit monitoring services to patients who request them.
 
 In August, Truman was hit with a ransomware attack that locked the hospital out of parts of its computer system.
 
 Truman agreed to pay a small, undisclosed amount of money to the ransomware attackers to unlock the data. The hospital said that patients’ personal health and financial information was kept on another system and was not affected by that attack.
 
 Data breaches are a huge problem for the healthcare industry, costing it $4 billion this year, according to a survey by Black Book Market Research. The survey says that more than 93% of healthcare organizations have experienced a data breach in the last three years and 57% have had more than five data breaches during the same period.
 
 In the first seven months of 2019 alone, more than 31 million health records in the U.S. were compromised by security breaches. That was more than double the number of incidents affecting the healthcare industry in all of 2018.
 
 Medical records can command up to $1,000 on the internet’s dark web – encrypted online content that’s accessible only with special browsers – compared with up to $110 for credit card information or $1 for Social Security numbers.
 
 A year ago, a local anesthesia group notified 3,472 patients that some of their personal information may have been compromised after surgery schedules were stolen from an employee’s car.
 
 Anesthesia Associates of Kansas City, which is based in Overland Park, said that a nurse anesthetist had placed a backpack containing the schedules in a visible part of his car – a violation of the group’s data security protocols.
 
 Last month, another laptop theft, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, involved 3,237 patient records.
 
 And in September, Ferguson Medical Group in Sikeston, Missouri, was hit with a ransomware attack, rendering inaccessible medical records for services the group had provided before Jan. 1, 2019.

 UMCP has no evidence of actual or attempted misuse of personal information at this time.
 
 On March 12, 2019, UMCP discovered that two employed providers had each established a Google shared drive to track follow-up tasks related to patient care, such as: lab results, appointments, procedures, and therapies. One employee was forwarding emails to an unsecured Google Gmail account. UMCP immediately retrieved and/or deleted the affected files and simultaneously started an investigation to determine the scope of the information disclosed and to identify the affected patients.
 
 Although the two providers intended to ensure good patient care by taking these actions, the security of patients’ protected health information (“PHI”) was compromised by storing it on an unsecured network. The PHI in some files included only a patient name and email address. However, some files contained some or all of the following: name, address, phone number, medical record number, date of birth, date of service, health insurance carrier, diagnosis, and/or procedure. No financial information, such as social security numbers, insurance policy numbers, or credit card information, was involved.

 The hackers sent an email created to look like an authentic request from an executive asking employees to complete a business survey. Despite education and training to recognize this type of phishing attack, a number of employees accessed the survey and provided their username and password to the hackers, allowing the hackers to access the employees’ email accounts as well as the payroll system. UAB Medicine’s electronic health record and billing systems were not impacted by the attack.
 
 UAB Medicine discovered emails had been compromised in the phishing attack Aug. 7, 2019. The affected accounts were secured upon identification, and passwords for those accounts were reset. Kroll, a leading cybersecurity firm, was engaged to assist with the investigation of the breach.
 
 The investigation revealed the cybercriminals were attempting to divert employees’ automatic payroll deposits to an account controlled by the hackers. UAB Medicine prevented all attempts by the hackers to re-direct payroll deposits. There is no evidence the hackers were looking for, accessed or stole any protected health information contained in the compromised accounts. However, limited amounts of protected health information could have been viewed by the hackers while they had access to the affected email accounts.
 
 As a result of this attack, UAB Medicine is notifying 19,557 patients their protected health information has been exposed and could potentially have been viewed by the hackers. The protected health information varied but may have included the patient’s name with one or more of the following data elements: medical record number, birth date, dates of service, location of service, diagnosis and treatment information. Social Security numbers were included for a small subset of patients, and those patients have been specifically notified.

2012,University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,AR,Unauthorized Disclosure,Other,"April 20, 2012 | LITTLE ROCK – The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has discovered a breach of patient information, which resulted when a document sent to an individual outside of UAMS for analysis of billing charges was not properly de-identified.
 
 The UAMS HIPAA Office investigates all potential breaches of protected health information. A UAMS physician sent financial data to an individual who was not a member of UAMS’s workforce in mid-February 2012, with the intention of removing all patient identifiers. On April 6, UAMS discovered that the data did in fact contain identifiers, including patient names, UAMS account numbers, dates of service, interventional radiology procedures, diagnosis codes, and charges and payments, for approximately 7,000 patients. Patients affected were interventional radiology patients seen at UAMS during 2009, 2010 and 2011.
 
 No credit card, debit card, bank account or Social Security numbers were included in this information.
 
 UAMS contacted the recipient of the data, and was assured that he had not disclosed the information to anyone else and that he did not look at or use patient names when he worked on his financial analysis. UAMS did discover that the data was transmitted via a web-based email service, which our IT Security Officer has determined to be a moderate risk. UAMS IT Security worked with the recipient to ensure that the information was permanently destroyed and no longer at risk. The UAMS employee who failed to properly de-identify the data has been placed in the disciplinary process for violating UAMS policies. UAMS also is conducting additional training of its workforce and evaluating its policies to prevent an incident like this from recurring.
 
 “UAMS takes patient privacy and security seriously, and when we discovered this mistake, we did everything we could to mitigate the risk and prevent similar incidents from happening” said Vera Chenault, UAMS privacy officer. “We want patients to know what steps to take to protect themselves in the event that their information might have been included.”
 
 UAMS has set up a toll-free telephone number for individuals to call for more information. Any interventional radiology patients who were seen at UAMS during 2009, 2010 or 2011 who believe their personal information might have been compromised in this incident should call 877-615-3745 if they have questions or concerns. Letters have been mailed to affected individuals.
 
 UAMS is the state’s only comprehensive academic health center, with colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Health Related Professions and Public Health; a graduate school; a hospital; a statewide network of regional centers; and seven institutes: the Winthrop P.

 The security of protected health information at UCSF is of utmost importance. While there is no evidence at this time that there has been any attempted access or attempted use of the information stored on the laptop, UCSF is responding with the highest level of caution and concern.
 
 Notification letters have been sent to the 8,294 individuals whose information was contained on the laptop. The California Department of Public Health and the California Attorney General have been alerted, and federal authorities are also being notified. Additionally, a special phone line has been established to provide information and assistance to individuals who receive the notification letters, and credit monitoring is being offered to some individuals whose Social Security numbers were involved.
 
 UCSF learned on Sept. 25 that the personal laptop computer had been stolen that evening from the locked vehicle of the physician, based in the Division of Gastroenterology at the UCSF School of Medicine. Upon discovering the theft, the physician promptly alerted San Francisco police, UCSF police and UCSF officials.
 
 Since UCSF could not verify that the laptop was encrypted, UCSF immediately began a technical analysis to identify what information was on the laptop. The analysis revealed that the laptop contained some personal and health information of individuals, including dates of birth, medical record numbers and Social Security numbers.
 
 Also stolen were paper documents for four patients, some of whose information was on the laptop. Information in the paper documents contained some personal and health information, including health insurance subscriber numbers.
 
 The UCSF investigation determined that it was appropriate for the physician to have this information; however, the use of an unencrypted laptop for business purposes is against UCSF’s policy and practice.
 
 UCSF is committed to maintaining the privacy of personal information and has taken additional steps to secure that information, including strengthening educational and operational processes for information security.

The proposed settlement would resolve a lawsuit stemming from their disclosure (pdf) earlier this year that thousands of patients’ billing vouchers stored with an off-site storage vendor were missing.
 
 At the time of the breach notification, UM revealed that the breach, affecting patients at the Department of Otolaryngology, had been discovered six months earlier. The patient billing vouchers included name, date of birth, Social Security number, physician’s name, facility, insurance company name, medical record number, visit number, procedure and diagnostic codes.
 
 The incident was subsequently added to HHS’s public breach tool as having occurred in June 2013, and affecting 13,074 patients. In actuality, the incident was discovered in June 2013, but when the loss actually occurred was never revealed.
 
 The complaint (pdf), filed in February by Joan Carsten as a potential class action lawsuit, originally described the breach as what appeared to be a hack. In an amended complaint, however, the plaintiff alleged that an employee stole the missing records.
 
 Carsten’s complaint and amended complaint alleged that she had suffered financial harm due to the breach because money was withdrawn from her banking account. No financial or banking information was included in the lost or missing records, however, so she might have had an uphill battle showing causation. The amended complaint cites the usual allegations of failure to adequately secure information, failure to timely notify those affected, risk of future harm, violations of Florida law, and violations of the Fair Credit Report Act. The complaint also alleges that U. Miami transferred patient records to the storage vendor without patients’ knowledge or consent.
 
 As I wrote after reading the original complaint, I thought the lawsuit was a non-starter, and even the amended complaint strikes me as weak. I’m a bit surprised that U. Miami was willing to settle this as I think they would have prevailed, although perhaps the settlement may be far cheaper than protracted litigation.
 
 Under the terms of the proposed settlement (pdf), the university would pay up to $100,000 to settle individuals’ claims, up to $90,000 for attorneys’ fees, and an incentive award of $1,500 to Carsten for her services as class representative. There are also non-monetary terms that include conducting risk assessments and remediating problems if they are identified and ensuring vendors have adequate security controls in place and in their contracts – in other words, pretty much what HIPAA requires anyway. U. Miami does not admit any wrongdoing or liability as part of the settlement.

Doctor Loses Flash Drive With Patient Information
January 31, 2008
By Esme Murphy

Parents with fertility problems know that it's a very private struggle. Couples often don't even tell close friends or relatives they're having trouble having a baby.

That's why the loss of patient information at the University of Minnesota's Reproductive Medicine Center has leaders there especially worried.

Dr. Theodore Nagel, a doctor at the fertility clinic, lost a flash drive that he used to back up his computer. The drive holds details of infertility treatments for 3,100 patients going back to 1999.

""The physician who is affected is absolutely mortified and we are also very concerned,"" said Dr. Bobbi Daniels, U of M Physicians Medical Director.

Anyone who finds this lost drive can merely plug it into their computer and all the information will be available.

University of Minnesota regulations require doctors to encode information on flash drives. Nagel did not do that on his flash drive nor did he use a password.

""Its a concern to us that that didn't occur here,"" said Daniels.

""I think this would be the hardest for people that are currently undergoing fertility treatments,"" said Amy Anderson, a former infertility patient.

Anderson now works with Resolve an infertility support group.

""You are talking about your sexuality and just a lot of private medical issues,"" said Anderson.

She underwent fertility treatments at the same University of Minnesota clinic where Nagel works. Anderson gave birth to twin girls two-and-half years ago. Her information was not on the drive.

While she worries about the patients, she also sympathizes with the doctor.

""It is hard but once and a while accidents do happen,"" said Anderson.

Nagel reported the loss of the drive himself and he's written the patients a letter of apology.

The clinic has also set up a hot line for those affected. The lost drive did not contain any financial or social security information.

2013,University of Mississippi Medical Center,MS,Loss,Laptop,"UMMC Investigated After Theft of Unencrypted Laptop Computer

The settlement stems from a breach of patients’ protected health information (PHI) in 2013. A laptop computer issued to UMMC’s Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) was discovered to be missing. The laptop computer contained the PHI of 500 patients. The data were not encrypted, although the laptop computer was password protected. The laptop is believed to have been stolen by a visitor who had asked about borrowing one of MICU’s laptops.
OCR conducted an investigation into the breach and discovered the exposure of 500 patients PHI was one of the least worrying issues. Potentially much more serious was the failure of UMMC to adequately secure its wireless network from external access. Investigators discovered 67,000 files were stored in an active directory, which included 328 files containing ePHI. A generic username and password had not been changed, which could have been exploited to gain access to the data of 10,000 patients that were stored on one of UMMC’s network drives.
Breach Investigation Revealed Multiple HIPAA Violations

Multiple violations of HIPAA Rules were also discovered. UMMC had failed to implement its policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations according to the resolution agreement.
A comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI had also not been satisfactorily conducted. Risks to ePHi had not been reduced to a reasonable and appropriate level, violating the HIPAA Security Rule 45 C.F.R. §164.308(a)(1)(i).
Sufficient physical controls had not been implemented to prevent ePHI from being accessed by unauthorized individuals – A violation of 45 C.F.R. §164.310(c)).
Unique identifiers/usernames had not been assigned, which prevented UMMC from being able to track which individuals had accessed ePHI – A violation of 45 C.F.R. § 164.312 (a)(2)(i).
UMMC had also violated the Breach Notification Rule by failing to inform patients whose ePHI was reasonably believed to have been accessed, acquired, used, or disclosed as a result of the data breach – A violation of 45 C.F.R. §164.404. UMMC had only posted a breach notice on its website and issued a notification to the media.
An extensive CAP has been adopted to ensure that all potential HIPAA violations are addressed and privacy and security is brought up to the level required by HIPAA. UMMC is also required to issue regular reports to OCR. The CAP will last for a period of 3 years.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,2920.0,500.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

The information did not include patient names, addresses, Social Security numbers, or any financial information. Though it is possible for patients to be identified, the odds of it occurring are extremely low based on how the information is labeled in the database.

UMMC and MSDH are working together to notify these 1,400 patients impacted by the breach through letters mailed Dec. 19.

A second smaller database also was contained on the laptop and included sensitive protected health information of approximately 75 UMMC patients. These patients are being contacted directly by UMMC.

""We take any breach of patients' personal health information very seriously, and we apologize for this occurrence. We are reviewing our study procedures to prevent this from happening again,"" said Dr. James Keeton, UMMC vice chancellor for healt+R791h affairs.

The laptop theft occurred when UMMC employees failed to follow departmental guidelines and left the laptop unsecured for a short period of time. Since t+R796hen, disciplinary actions have been taken against the responsible employees.

Despite vigorous efforts, attempts to recover the stolen laptop have been unsuccessful. The clinic has safeguards in place to ensure the privacy and security of all patient health information, when procedures are properly followed.",1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0.0,1475.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Wednesday, March 29, 2017 - Front Page -; Revised May 24, 2017
OU Physicians is committed not only to providing quality care, but also to the proper handling and protection of its patients' information. As part of its commitment to patient privacy, and out of an abundance of caution, OU Physicians is sending letters to certain individuals to notify them of a potential privacy matter.
On February 8, 2017, (not February 13, 2017, a originally reported) the University of Oklahoma became aware that a resident provider in the Department of Medicine who had been involved in the treatment or care of some of its patients had set his University email account to automatically forward his email messages to his personal email account from mid-2013 through mid-February 2017. The University did not have specific information about the security of the resident provider’s personal email account, so University personnel conducted a review of the matter, which included interviewing the provider, confirming account security settings, and reviewing account activity.
The University determined in its thorough review of this matter, which it completed on March 9, that the provider forwarded his University email messages to his personal account to make it more convenient for him to respond quickly to messages regarding clinic schedules, assignments, patient care, and other matters. In an abundance of caution, the University is making approximately 1,600 patients aware that it was possible for the forwarded email messages to have been viewed by someone not authorized to see them. These patients will receive one of three letters, based on what information was in the email messages. Some messages included name and limited medical information (diagnosis, medication list, and/or laboratory tests); some included that information and date of birth; and 88 included Social Security number as well. Neither the University nor the provider has any knowledge that any of the messages were viewed by an unauthorized person.
In response to this occurrence, the University has adopted more specific policies regarding the automatic forwarding of email messages that include patient information. The provider is no longer using automatic forwarding and has deleted these messages from his personal account. The technology that automatically forwards email messages to personal email accounts has been disabled from resident provider accounts and training on other ways for workforce members to securely transmit these types of email messages off campus is in place.
No negative impact to patients is anticipated, but the University does take this matter seriously and understands that some patients may have concerns. Patients may monitor their credit report by obtaining a free credit report annually from certain credit reporting services, as described at http://www.ftc.gov/freereports. In addition, to ensure any concerns are addressed, the University is offering to provide a one-year subscription to credit monitoring and reporting services at no cost to the patients involved. Individuals who believe they may be affected may call 405-271-2511 or toll-free at 1-866-836-3150 for additional information.

PHI: The University of Tennessee Medical Center Joins the Parade of Potential Security Breaches
By Michael Kline on December 12, 2010
POSTED IN SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION

This blog has been following the continuing flow of security breaches of Protected Health Information (""PHI"") and how affected providers and insurers have been responding to their discovery. The University of Tennessee Medical Center (""UTMC"" or the ""hospital"") based in Knoxville has apparently joined in the march.

On November 29, 2010, Angela Starke wrote an article entitled ""Patients uneasy about possible security breach at UT Medical Center"" that was posted on volunteertv.com. In the article, Ms. Starke reported that UTMC had announced that 8,000 patients’ medical and identity information may have been compromised. As part of her article, Ms. Starke reproduced in full the letter attributed to the Privacy Officer of UTMC that was sent to affected patients by the hospital (the ""Letter""). The following was stated in the UTMC Letter: ""Please note we have no reason to believe that any of your personal information has actually been accessed or inappropriately used. However, out of an abundance of caution, we want to make you aware of the incident.""

What is interesting about the UTMC event is that the hospital apparently has not seen the incident as sufficiently newsworthy to publish the UTMC Letter on its website in the news section or elsewhere. In contrast, a recent post on this blog discussed a PHI security breach issue at Henry Ford Health System in Michigan (""HFHS""). That post raised questions as to the thoroughness of the report that HFHS had placed on its website relative to the incident.

Nonetheless, HFHS did at least disclose the matter on its website. UTMC has chosen not to do so. The article by Ms. Starke would indicate that patients who received notices from UTMC about the PHI incident considered it to be somewhat more of a concern than the hospital did, as evidenced by UTMC’s failure to make a disclosure on its website.

A visit today to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (""HHS"") website which lists reported breaches of unsecured PHI incidents affecting 500 or more individuals reveals that the UTMC matter is now posted. Even that posting, however, is defective. The list reflects the ""Date of Breach"" of the UTMC event of ""Improper Disposal of Paper Records"" as ""2009-09-23."" Obviously the year should be ""2010"" not the ""2009"" date listed. It is unclear whether the hospital reported the wrong year to HHS or that HHS incorrectly transcribed it.

As this blog has reported earlier, the public disclosures required by HIPAA/HITECH for breaches respecting PHI make providers and insurers vulnerable to embarrassment, criticism and diminished reputation that may actually overshadow the significant legal costs and statutory consequences of the breach itself.

To this end, providers and insurers must continue to heighten their efforts to avoid PHI security breaches as a primary objective. If they do occur, prompt, decisive and proactive action is required to maximize damage control and rehabilitate relations with clients and the public. Such action should include posting of the unfortunate event on the entity’s website.

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah — The John A. Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah is notifying 607 patients of a potential disclosure of some of their information following a theft of electronic equipment.

On April 3, 2018, the Moran Eye Center learned a laptop computer and an associated external storage device used to take and store retinal images were stolen from locked storage at 65 Mario Capecchi Drive in Salt Lake City.

Moran has now determined the devices contained limited patient information for 602 infants and 5 adults who had images taken by Moran specialists conducting evaluations at the University of Utah Hospital and Primary Children’s Hospital between July 1, 2014 and March 30, 2018.

The Moran equipment stored the following information:

Courier violated protocol, taking data home instead of directly to off-site storage facility
By Brian Fonseca, Computerworld, JUN 11, 2008

University of Utah officials this week acknowledged that a metal box of backup tapes containing billing records of some 2.2 million patients was stolen early this month from the car of a courier who left it in a parked car overnight outside his home.

The missing tapes were taken on June 2 from the car of an employee of Perpetual Storage Inc., an independent storage company hired by the university to transport its computer tapes to off-site facilities, said school officials. The tapes contained names, demographic information and Social Security numbers of patients of the University of Utah Hospitals & Clinics.

The health care system has suspended all backup tape deliveries to Perpetual Storage pending a full review of the company's protocols and procedures, said a university spokeswoman.

The spokeswoman confirmed that Perpetual Storage fired the individual involved with the data breach for violating company data security transportation protocols. The driver had been employed by Perpetual Storage for 18 years, she said.

The spokeswoman said the driver informed his employer immediately upon discovering that the tapes were lost. Perpetual Storage informed the University of Utah Hospitals & Clinics officials within 24 hours
of the breach, she added.

Perpetual Storage did not immediately return calls by Computerworld seeking comment.

The university spokeswoman declined to say whether any of the missing data storage tapes were
encrypted.

Lorris Betz, senior vice president for health sciences and CEO of University of Utah Health & Clinics, said in a posted alert that it's unlikely that any information on the backup tapes will be exposed to thieves. ""Although it is unlikely that information on the tapes will be compromised, we are nevertheless taking aggressive steps to protect our patients' confidentiality,"" Betz said in the post.
The university plans to mail notification letters to all patients whose data was held on the stolen tapes and offer them free credit-monitoring services. The missing tapes did not hold any credit card information, noted school officials.

The university is offering a reward of $1,000 for the return of the stolen tapes with ""no questions asked.""

The Salt Lake County Sheriff's Department, the FBI and U.S. Postal Service are investigating the theft.

Two laptop computers were stolen from an off-campus UW Medical Center office late last month with the names and personal data of about 1,600 patients of the UW Travel Medicine Service, a university official confirms.

The laptops were stolen from the UW office in the Northgate Executive Center, either late Dec. 29 or early Dec. 30, UW Medicine spokeswoman Clare Hagerty said.

One of the two computers contains password-protected information about the patients, which could include their names, social security numbers, maiden names, birth dates, diagnoses and other personal data -- but not including their detailed medical records -- Hagerty said. Each of the affected patients was notified by a Jan. 10 letter sent by a UW Medical Center privacy officer.

No one has yet been arrested for the theft, Hagerty said.

One of the patients, Kathy Cranston, has since set up a ""blog community"" at Live Journal -- go to www.livejournal. com/userinfo.bml?user=uwm cidprotect06 for information -- so that affected patients can share information regarding possible cases of identity theft or fraud.

2017,University of Wisconsin - Madison,WI,Unauthorized Disclosure,Paper/Films,"1. On Nov. 3, 2016, the University of Wisconsin–Madison became aware that a database within its Law School was the target of computer hacking. The database contained Social Security Numbers and name pairs corresponding with Law School applicants from 2005-2006. No other personal identification information was contained in the files.
 
 Since learning of the incident, the university has removed from the server the records that were likely accessed by the attacker. Security measures have been increased, including implementing additional vulnerability identification programs, evaluating current computer applications and decommissioning those no longer needed, tightening credentials for access to databases, and deploying additional network intrusion detection. Notices were mailed and emailed to the 1,213 individuals affected by this unauthorized access on Dec. 6, 2016.
 
 The incident has been reported to law enforcement for further investigation, and to three national credit reporting agencies. The individuals affected by this breach will receive free credit monitoring for one year to help protect them against identify theft.
 
 FAQ for those affected by the Law School data breach
 
 Is this letter for real?
 
 Yes, the letter was sent by the University of Wisconsin Law School.
 
 Exactly what happened?
 
 On Nov. 3, a computer security incident on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus may have exposed records containing the names and Social Security Numbers of former University of Wisconsin Law School applicants.
 
 The Law School became aware of an outside computer hacker on its server containing admissions applicant information from 2005-2006.
 
 An internal investigation revealed that the attacker likely obtained 1,213 unique Social Security Number and name pairs corresponding to Law School student applicant data.
 
 Why am I only being contacted now?
 
 Our Cybersecurity Office first needed to investigate exactly what happened, who was affected, and how the data was accessed (and by whom) in order to determine next steps. Once it was determined which records were accessed, we used several sources to locate current contact information for as many of the 1,213 applicants as possible. We also contacted authorities to investigate the hacker. And we made arrangements with a theft prevention services provider for affected individuals. Wisconsin state law requires that notice be provided within 45 days of the discovery of the unauthorized access. A team expedited this work as quickly as possible.
 
 Is my personal data at risk?
 
 Based on our assessment of the circumstances, we cannot be certain. We are contacting you so you know and have options for protection. As soon as the Law School became aware that a server containing your name and Social Security Number was attached, the information was immediately removed. Due to this incident, we are offering theft protection services through ID Experts, a data breach and recovery services expert, to provide you with MyIDCare for one year.

 2. The University of Wisconsin-Madison on Tuesday announced that a database at its law school suffered a data breach on Nov. 3, exposing personally identifiable information belonging to over 1,000 former applicants.
 
 How many victims? 1,123 prospective students from 2005-2006.
 
 What type of information? The database contained applicants’ Social Security numbers, which were paired with corresponding names. No other personal data was accessed, according to UW-Madison.
 
 What Happened? On Nov. 3, university officials discovered that a hacker had gained unauthorized access to the University of Wisconsin Law School’s server earlier that day. Upon discovery of the breach, UW-Madison removed the affected records from the hacked server and contacted law enforcement authorities. The University of Wisconsin Police Department is now leading the investigation.
 
 What was the response? UW-Madison began reaching out to affected individuals via email and snail email on Dec. 6, and is offering victims free credit monitoring and ID theft protection for one year.
 
 Via its website, the university stated that it has increased security by “implementing additional vulnerability identification programs, evaluating current computer applications and decommissioning those no longer needed, tightening credentials for access to databases, and deploying additional network intrusion detection.”
 
 Citing a police spokesman, the Wisconsin State Journal on Tuesday reported that investigators have identified a potential suspect who lives out of state. As of Dec. 9, no arrests have been made.

2016,University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Authority,WI,Unauthorized Disclosure,Paper/Films,"1. Madison-based University of Wisconsin Health is notifying patients of a data breach after mistakenly sending patient satisfaction surveys to some patients' parents instead of the patients themselves. While the envelopes were addressed to the parents or guardians of patients, the cover letter was accurately addressed to the patient. The patient surveys included the name of the provider who treated the patient.
 
 UW Health says the mailing error stemmed from an improperly formatted computer file, and the system worked to prevent further envelopes from being misaddressed.
 
 The breach affects 6,923 individuals, according to HHS Office for Civil Rights' breach notification portal.
 
 ""We apologize for the error and regret any confusion or concern it may have caused,"" reads UW Health's statement. ""To help prevent something like this from happening in the future we have re-educated the staff involved.""
 
 2. October 13, 2016 - Arkansas-based Baxter Regional Home Health Facility (Baxter Home Health) announced that certain patients and employees may have had some of their information exposed in a data security incident that took place in August 2016.
 
 Data security incidents stem from unauthorized employee access, vendor error
 Baxter Home Health learned on August 5 that a break-in took place at its Cotter facility overnight. The Cotter location contained hard copy files that could have been accessed by the unauthorized individuals.
 
 “We have no information to suggest that any records were viewed or removed from the facility, and none of our electronic records or computer systems were impacted,” Baxter Home Health said in its statement. “We are nonetheless providing notice to potentially-affected patients and employees out of an abundance of caution.”
 
 The patient information that may have been affected includes names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, government identification numbers, insurance identifiers and diagnostic information. Employee information may have included names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, licensure information, and information about previous employers.
 
 Law enforcement was contacted, and Baxter Home Health added that it completed an internal investigation and assessment of its own security practices.
 
 “We are currently working to increase security measures at the facility, and to that end, have changed locks and will be installing cameras and alarm systems to better secure this facility,” the facility explained.
 
 Baxter Home Health did not specify how many individuals were potentially affected, but the OCR data breach reporting tool states that 2,124 may be impacted by the incident.
 
 R-C Healthcare Breach affects Illinois facility
 
 An Illinois hospital recently added its name to the list of healthcare organizations affected by the R-C Healthcare Management data breach.
 
 Northwest Community Hospital (NCH) reported that 550 of its patients may have had their information exposed in the vendor breach, according to a Daily Herald article.
 
 R-C Healthcare made nonclinical patient information potentially accessible online from April 18 through June 13. 
 
 While it is unclear if any NCH patient information was stolen, the potentially affected data included full names, dates of service, amount due, amount collected and Social Security numbers.
 
 ""We sincerely apologize and regret that this situation has occurred, and we are taking significant steps to ensure this type of incident does not occur again,"" NCH said in a statement.
 
 Veterans claims documents discovered in employee storage unit
 
 The Virginia Department of Veterans Services (DVS) announced last week that veterans claims documents were included in the documents recently discovered in a former DVS employee’s storage unit.
 
 DVS said in its statement that the exact amount of claims discovered was not known, but that they all appeared to be dated between 2011 and mid-2015, and exclusively from the DVS benefits office at McGuire VAMC.
 
 Technical experts are reviewing all the materials, DVS reported. They will work to determine the number of impacted veterans, their identities and the status of their claims, but it “will take a number of weeks to complete.”
 
 The agency’s director of benefits, Thomas Herthel, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that 20 to 30 boxes of documents were recovered and included “everything from claims to medical records to miscellaneous correspondence.”
 
 DVS explained that the former employee in question worked at the agency from January 2012 until August 25, 2015. Unfiled claims were found in the individual’s office in August 2015.
 
 “Those claims were reviewed, and DVS contacted affected veterans to advise them and provide assistance,” DVS stated. “DVS terminated the employee at that time and has since assigned a new office manager for that location.”
 
 Secretary of Veterans and Defense Affairs John Harvey said that he was deeply concerned about the veterans whose information was mishandled, and that his team is working to ensure those veterans receive the necessary benefits.
 
 “At the beginning of this administration, we identified a vulnerability in the Commonwealth’s claims process, and we began implementing a solution to this serious deficiency,” Harvey continued. “Regrettably, our fears were justified, and the danger we were working so hard to address was already a reality. We stand ready to assist any and all veterans impacted, and we are determined to prevent any similar mishandling of information from happening in the future.”
 
 Error with patient satisfaction surveys leads to data security issue
 
 The University of Wisconsin-Madison health system, UW Health, explained in a statement that a recent mailing error may have exposed a limited amount of patient information.
 
 Patient satisfaction surveys were recently mailed out between July 29, 2016, and August 2, 2016. On August 3, UW Health said it became aware “that the survey and cover letter were mailed to the patient in an envelope mistakenly addressed with the prefix: ‘To the parent or guardian of [patient's name],’ rather than directly to the patient.”
 
 “The enclosed cover letter was accurately addressed to the patient, and included the name of the healthcare provider that treated the patient,” the statement read. “We were able to determine that the cause was an improperly formatted computer file and quickly prevented any further misaddressed mailings from being sent to our patients.”
 
 According to the OCR data breach reporting tool, 6,923 individuals were potentially affected by the incident. UW Health maintained that “only some patients who came to one of our facilities or clinics and received the letter.”
 
 UW Health added that it has re-educated staff members to ensure that the same type of incident does not happen again. 
 
 Email error creates privacy breach at Illinois company
 
 An Illinois-based medical products and services company recently announced that it had experienced a privacy breach that potentially affected 992 individuals.
 
 Baxter said in an online statement that human error led to an email being sent out on September 15, 2016 that included individual email addresses for all intended recipients in the ‘To’ field of the message. The individuals were being asked to participate in a product-specific Patient Advisory Council.
 
 Baxter said that no other personal or health information was involved in the isolated incident. The facility became aware of the email error on September 16, and then attempted to recall it.
 
 “The company has extensive security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any personal information,” according to the statement. “Baxter’s information security program includes policies, compliance systems and employee training, and the company enforces appropriate use and protection of the company’s information and technology.”

2015,UPMC University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,PA,Theft,Other,"1. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center – 2,259 patient records
 
 A former employee of medical billing company Medical Management LLC – a business associate of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) – has been accused of copying “personal information from the billing system” for nearly two years and disclosing that information to a third party. 2,259 UPMC patients have been notified by letter that their information, including names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers, may have been compromised. A UPMC statement notes that “[there] is no evidence that information about medical histories or treatments was disclosed.”
 
 2. A Business Associate (BA) of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has notified the healthcare provider, and numerous other clients, of a HIPAA breach caused by a rogue employee. The now former employee is alleged to have stolen the records of 2,259 patients.
 
 Medical Management LLC – a medical billing company – was notified by federal law enforcement agencies that a member of staff at the company was believed to have stolen and disclosed confidential data and that the incident was being investigated. The employee in question – who has not been named – was a worker in the company’s call center. That person has been accused of copying “personal information from the billing system” and disclosing the information to a third party.
 
 Social Security Numbers and Personally Identifiable Information Stolen
 Patients affected by the breach are being sent breach notification letters from today to alert them that their personal information has been obtained and disclosed. They have been advised that their names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers had been compromised. Breach notification letters should be received by all affected individuals in the next few days.
 
 Not all UPMC patients have been affected, as the data stolen related to patients that had received treatment at UPMC emergency departments. Patients affected by the breach are being offered credit monitoring services with Kroll Inc. for a period of a year without charge to help protect against identity theft, medical & insurance fraud.
 
 HIPAA Breach Attributed to a Disgruntled Employee
 UPMC’s vice president of privacy and information security, John Houston, explained in a statement that efforts are being made to improve security to prevent future breaches of this nature occurring again.
 
 “We apologize for any anxiety or inconvenience that this incident may cause for our patients. We hold our vendors to the same high privacy standards that we have for ourselves. Based upon the ongoing investigation, we will make whatever changes might be necessary to further enhance our already stringent privacy protections, especially those that apply to our business partners.”
 
 Second HIPAA Breach Involving UPMC
 This is not the first time UPMC has had to deal with a data breach. Last year it was attacked by a hacker who managed to steal a database containing personal information of all 62,000 of UPMC’s employees.
 
 Hackers broke through UPMC’s defenses in February, with the incident not being discovered until April. The investigation into the data breach revealed that Social Security numbers, financial information, salary details, bank account numbers and other confidential information has been stolen.

2012,Upper Valley Medical Center (via Data Image),OH,Other,Other,"TROY — 
 An 18-month data breach involving 15,000 patients at Upper Valley Medical Center in Troy allowed unauthorized access to patients’ names, address, hospital account number and balanced owed. No clinical information was accessible.
 
 
 A legal notice published in area newspapers in late May said that the information may have been accessed through contractor Data Image’s online billing system. Hospital spokeswoman Gail Peterson said customers were informed of the breach in May by a letter from Data Image, which said one patient reported being able to see other patients’ data.The letter also stated Data Image reloaded the online billing files to the correct accounts and filtered the billing statements to prevent unauthorized access.The U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services is required to post a list of breaches of unsecured protected health information affecting 500 or more individuals.The UVMC breach involved unauthorized access/disclosure from October 1, 2010 to March 21, 2012.“There was a technical programming error put in place 18 months (before it was discovered)” Peterson said. “The incident reported in March was the first time we learned of the program.”Peterson added that reporting requirements were followed that allow for 60 days to gather information before notifying patients.The breach wasn’t disclosed on the government website until July 3. Peterson said the health department was informed earlier than that.
 
 “It wasn’t open to the public,” Data Image general manager Marty Callahan said of the programming error. “There was no breach outside of our walls. That went undetected until a singe patient notified us that they were able to see another invoice or bill. Callahan said he knew of no other instance where Data Image has been involved in a security breach.“In closing, we acknowledge that it was our responsibility to you and Upper Valley Medical Center to protect your personal information,” Data Image’s letter concluded. “However, we have taken the appropriate actions to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”Upper Valley Medical Center, which is part of Premier Health Partners, has used Data Image’s services since 2008.

2016,USC Keck Hospital,CA,HACK,Network Server,"1. Another Californian healthcare organization has been attacked with ransomware. Two computer servers operated by Keck Medical Center of USC were taken out of action on August 1 when ransomware was installed. No ransom was paid and all data could be recovered from backups, although restoring the files took a number of days.
 
 Electronic health records were not encrypted in the attack, although some of the files on the servers did include PHI including patients’ names, dates of birth, demographic information, treatment information, medical diagnoses, and in some cases, Social Security numbers.
 
 Patients impacted by the breach had visited the La Canada-Flintridge clinic between August 1, 2011 and August 1, 2016, participated in the Department of Family Medicine’s former residency program between 1999 and 2008, or had visited outpatient hospital clinics and had submitted a request for information between July 2015 and August 2016.
 
 Patients are now being informed of the incident and are being offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection services, although the attack is not believed to have involved the theft of any patient health information. Most of the files encrypted by the ransomware were internal documents such as HR material, training documents, templates, and other files required for hospital operations.
 
 According to the breach notice, swift action was taken upon discovery of the attack which limited the severity of the incident. All traces of the ransomware have now been removed from the servers, although the internal investigation into the attack is ongoing. The breach report issued to Office for Civil Rights indicates 16,000 individuals have been impacted.
 
 The attack has prompted a review of data security and steps have already been taken to improve the speed of detection and response to incidents involving malware and ransomware. Additional software has also been installed to monitor for malicious network traffic and the use of encryption for all data at rest is now also being reviewed.
 
 2. Keck Medicine, a part of the University of Southern California health system, is reporting a data breach involving two hospitals. The servers compromised held some patient and employee data.
 
 In a statement posted on its web site Keck Hospitals CEO and chief operating officer for Keck Medicine of USC Rodney Hanners reported that on Aug. 1 a ransomware attack occurred on servers at two hospitals including Keck Medical Center, a 240-bed hospital, and USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center Hospital, a 60-bed facility.
 
 Keck data center employees noticed the presence of ransomware on the pair of servers after hospital employees reported they couldnt access certain computer files.
 
 Ransomware is a type of malware that severely restricts access to a computer, device or file until a ransom is paid by the user. This class of malware is a criminal moneymaking scheme that can be installed through deceptive links in an e-mail message, instant message or website and can lock a computer screen or encrypt files with a password, says Kaspersky Lab, a developer of anti-virus software and related applications. The criminals typically then demand money in exchange for releasing the password so the hacked organization can access its files.
 
 In its statement Keck noted that the two impacted servers did not house the centers main electronic health records system but contained internal data used among hospital and clinic personnel such as templates for training manuals, human resources and other internal hospital operations. But Keck also notes that sensitive patient data was included in the ransomware attack including patient name and demographic information, data of birth, identifiable health information such as for patient diagnosis and treatment and some Social Security numbers.
 
 2. Keck didnt say how many patients were impacted by the cybercrime. But the sensitive patient data information impacted by the ransomware attack was substantial and included outpatient data containing Social Security information from July 27, 2015, through Aug.1 of this year for patients requesting a release of medical records, Keck says. Other files also included paycheck information for certain employees participating in a residency program from 1999 to 2008 and patient data such as billing forms from one of the centers clinics, according to Keck.
 
 Hanners states the ransomware attack was quickly contained and that no patient data was retrieved or accessed as a result of the ransomware. Keck also says it did not pay a ransom and did not release details if a ransom was demanded by the cyberthieves.
 
 Keck says it has notified the FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servcies Office of Civil Rights, which oversees hospital data breach administration, and various California state agencies. Keck also says it is working with Ernst & Young to review the steps the medical center took to investigate the incident and upgrade various computer systems and audit and logging programs, although Keck provide specifics.
 
 For patients and others impacted by the ransomware attack, Keck says it is offering free crediting monitoring and identity recovery services for a year.
 
 Cyberthieves can target multiple systems at random in order find an opening in one vulnerable area such as the data servers that were breached at Keck, says Don Miller, chief operations officer and general counsel for bTrade LLC, which develops secure managed file transfer software applications in vertical markets such as healthcare. The company’s customers include Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc among others.",1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,50.0,16000.0,1600000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2016,USC Norris Hospital,CA,HACK,Network Server,"Last week, USC Keck and Norris Hospitals reported that they had been the victims of a ransomware attack after detecting the malware on two servers. 
 
 The ransomware was noticed on August 1, 2016, and encrypted the files on both servers, according to a Keck statement signed by Keck Medicine COO and Keck Hospitals CEO Rod Hanners. The attack was contained and the ransomware did not spread to other servers.
 
 “The impacted servers do not store Keck’s electronic medical record system. Rather, many of the folders that were encrypted by the malware are departmental files that contain internal operational documents and that are intended to be used and shared by and among hospital clinic and personnel, such as templates, training manuals, human resource materials and other information needed for hospital operations,” Hanners said.
 
 The encrypted documents did contain certain sensitive information, including names and demographic information, dates of birth, identifiable health information, including treatment and diagnosis for some patients, and Social Security numbers in some cases.
 
 The statement also specified certain groups of patients that may have been affected, including outpatient hospital clinic patients that submitted a request to release health information between July 27, 2015 and August 1, 2016.
 
 Keck contended that there was no evidence that any data was “retrieved or accessed” in the ransomware attack. Even so, potentially affected patients are encouraged to check all credit or financial accounts to ensure there has been no suspicious activity.
 
 USC Keck and Norris hospitals will also offer complimentary credit monitoring and other identity recovery services for one year to those who were possibly affected by the incident.

2010,UT Southwestern Medical Center,TX,INSD,Other,"The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center is advising 12,000 patients to guard against fraud after a former employee was found in possession of a limited amount of patient billing data.
 
 Authorities discovered in September that a cashier in the hospital's finance department, Tracy Renay Thomas of Dallas, had billing and insurance information from 21 patients. The hospital alerted those patients by phone.
 
 Police found the breach during a widening inquiry into Thomas' boyfriend, Louis Tatum of Dallas. Authorities allege that Tatum, with aid from Thomas, engineered a theft ring meant to profit from stolen identities, according to court records.
 
 A grand jury has indicted Thomas and Tatum on fraud charges. Thomas was released on $5,000 bail, while Tatum remained in the Dallas County Jail on Friday.
 
 In all, hospital officials say, Thomas may have compromised the billing or insurance information of as many as 200 UT Southwestern patients. She did not have access to medical records, they said.
 
 The discovery prompted UT Southwestern to send a letter to 12,000 patients on Feb. 24 warning them of the breach. The letter went only to patients whose billing records were accessible to Thomas.
 
 UT Southwestern decided to mail letters to the larger group of patients out of ""an abundance of caution,"" hospital spokesman John Walls said.
 
 ""It's important to note that we're talking about a small group of people,"" he said. Walls said he could not recall a similar security breach at the hospital.
 
 Access to information
 
 Thomas, who worked at UT Southwestern from March until September 2009, had access to personal, insurance and payment information.
 
 Walls said no patients have yet been victimized by fraudulent charges to their accounts.
 
 Still, the hospital advised patients who received the letter to monitor their credit and consider placing their accounts under fraud detection alerts. In its letter, the hospital said it would provide concerned parties free credit monitoring services for up to a year.
 
 News of the records breach sparked concern among patients and their families.
 
 Michele Dempsey said hospital police first contacted her in September. Investigators showed her a check found at Thomas' house. It was a check Dempsey had sent to the hospital months earlier. The slip had her Social Security number and birth date written across the top.
 
 ""I don't like it happening to me. I've been scared since the day I found out,"" said Dempsey, 67, of Dallas.
 
 Handling questioned
 
 Jean Jury, 87, who has visited UT Southwestern recently to treat lung problems, received one of the hospital's warning letters this week. Son Harvey Jury wished the hospital had notified credit agencies on behalf of its patients.
 
 ""I was just irritated with the way they handled it,"" he said.
 
 UT Southwestern provides in-patient care to about 97,000 people annually, according to its Web site.
 
 As breaches in medical and other records have become more frequent, the government has begun requiring hospitals to disclose cases of stolen records. The federal Department of Health and Human Services keeps an online database that tracks the biggest incidents.
 
 Those records reflect several recent breaches in Texas, including nearly 700 records compromised in the Methodist Hospital System in January and 3,800 at Children's Medical Center Dallas in mid-November.
 
 Investigators continue to sort through Tatum's alleged theft ring, which includes accusations of credit card abuse and to obtain false credit lines and gift cards.
 
 Thomas' attorney, Phillip Robertson, said his client regrets how events have unfolded.
 
 ""She is so upset and ashamed and embarrassed about even being a part of this,"" he said.
 
 Selwyn Crawford also contributed to this report. SUGGESTIONS FROM HOSPITAL ABOUT POSSIBLE IDENTITY THEFT
 
 
 The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center offered these tips to the 12,000 patients who received a recent letter advising them of a theft of financial records.
 
 • The potential for theft applies only to those who received the warning letter.
 
 • Of the 12,000 people who received the letter, only 100 to 200 are thought to have had their information stolen.
 
 • Those who received the letter and still have questions can contact Cynthia Snyder, the hospital's privacy officer, at 877-887-9623 or at privacyoffice@utsouthwestern.edu. Those who call on the weekend can leave a message.",0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,150.0,200.0,20000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

UWM is an affiliated covered entity, which includes designated health care components and other entities under the control of the University of Washington, including University of Washington Medical Center, the primary teaching hospital of the University of Washington School of Medicine. Affiliated covered entities must have in place appropriate policies and processes to assure HIPAA compliance with respect to each of the entities that are part of the affiliated group. The settlement includes a monetary payment of $750,000, a corrective action plan, and annual reports on the organization’s compliance efforts.
 
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initiated its investigation of the UWM following receipt of a breach report on November 27, 2013, which indicated that the electronic protected health information (e-PHI) of approximately 90,000 individuals was accessed after an employee downloaded an email attachment that contained malicious malware. The malware compromised the organization’s IT system, affecting the data of two different groups of patients: 1) approximately 76,000 patients involving a combination of patient names, medical record numbers, dates of service, and/or charges or bill balances; and 2) approximately 15,000 patients involving names, medical record numbers, other demographics such as address and phone number, dates of birth, charges or bill balances, social security numbers, insurance identification or Medicare numbers.
 
 OCR’s investigation indicated UWM’s security policies required its affiliated entities to have up-to-date, documented system-level risk assessments and to implement safeguards in compliance with the Security Rule. However, UWM did not ensure that all of its affiliated entities were properly conducting risk assessments and appropriately responding to the potential risks and vulnerabilities in their respective environments.
 
 “All too often we see covered entities with a limited risk analysis that focuses on a specific system such as the electronic medical record or that fails to provide appropriate oversight and accountability for all parts of the enterprise,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “An effective risk analysis is one that is comprehensive in scope and is conducted across the organization to sufficiently address the risks and vulnerabilities to patient data.”

 2. SEATTLE — A computer security breach at UW Medicine led to the downloading of malware that enabled outside access to the data files of about 90,000 Harborview Medical Center and the UW Medical Center patients, UW Medicine said on its website.
 
 “Based on the results of an internal investigation, it is believed that patient information was not sought or targeted,” UW Medicine said in its Nov. 27 website post. “However, the malware accessed the data files of roughly 90,000 Harborview Medical Center and University of Washington Medical Center patients.”
 
 The Seattle Times said Social Security numbers of about 15,000 patients may have been stolen, and that UW Medicine is going to offer some patients a free credit-monitoring service for a period of time.
 
 UW Medicine said the incident was referred to the FBI and that patients may be contacted by the FBI as part of its investigation.
 
 “In early October 2013, a UW Medicine employee opened an email attachment that contained malicious software (malware),” the post said. “The malware took control of the computer, which had patient data stored on it. UW Medicine staff discovered this incident the following day and immediately took measures to prevent any further malicious activity.”
 
 It said data about patients may have included: name, medical record number, other demographics (which may include address, phone number), dates of service, charge amounts for services received at UW Medicine, Social Security Number or HIC (Medicare) number, and date of birth.
 
 “The affected patients will receive direct mail correspondence from UW Medicine. In addition, a vendor (ID Experts) will be managing a call center on behalf of UW Medicine. Beginning November 29th, the call center hours are 6 AM-6 PM Pacific Standard Time, Monday-Friday. The toll-free phone number is 1-877-271-1533, (International callers, please call 503-597-7682),” the UW Medicine post said.
 
 “UW Medicine is committed to providing quality care and protecting patients’ personal information, and sincerely apologizes for the inconvenience and concern this may be for affected patients,” it added.
 
 
 3. The University of Washington Medicine will spend $750,000 to settle charges that it potentially violated the HIPAA Security Rule by failing to implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain and correct security violations.
 
 The HHS Office for Civil Rights, which is charged with upholding the HIPAA Privacy Rule, announced the terms of the settlement on December 14.
 
 Specifically, OCR spotlighted insufficient risk analysis at UWM.
 
 The primary teaching hospital of the University of Washington School of Medicine, UWM is an affiliated covered entity under HIPAA. As such, it must have in place appropriate policies and processes to assure HIPAA compliance with respect to each of the entities that are part of the affiliated group.
 
 Besides paying a $750,000 settlement, UWM also agreed to a corrective action plan, and annual reports on the organization's compliance efforts.

 4. University of Washington Medicine has agreed to pay $750,000 to settle charges stemming from a breach of data of 90,000 patients.
 
 The November 2013 breach potentially exposed the data after a UW Medicine employee downloaded a malicious email attachment, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services news release.
 
 Wendy Giles, chief operating officer for IT services at UW Medicine, said in an interview that the 90,000 patients had been immediately notified at the time of the breach, and that UW offered free credit monitoring. No specific reports of the malicious use of the data have come to light, she said.
 
 For about 76,000 of the patients, the malware could have exposed names, medical record numbers, dates of service, and/or charges or bill balances. Another 15,000 patients’ compromised records also included information such as address and phone number, dates of birth, charges or bill balances, Social Security numbers, insurance identification or Medicare numbers.
 
 ""None of this was medical record information,"" Giles said.
 
 But by failing to have procedures fully in place to safeguard patients' data, UW Medicine potentially violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), HHS said in its news release.
 
 In addition to agreeing to pay HHS $750,000, UW Medicine will file a corrective action plan and annual reports on compliance.
 
 “An effective risk analysis is one that is comprehensive in scope and is conducted across the organization to sufficiently address the risks and vulnerabilities to patient data,” said Jocelyn Samuels, director of HHS Office of Civil Rights, in a statement.
 
 NOTE: This story was updated to include information from UW Medicine.",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,50.0,15000.0,1500000.0,1.0,750000.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2019,UW Medicine,WA,HACK,Network Server,"1. February 21, 2019 - The University of Washington Medicine is notifying about 974,000 individuals that some of their patient data was left exposed on the internet for three weeks due to a misconfigured server.
 
 The breach was discovered on December 26, when a patient conducted a Google search of their name and found a file containing their data. The patient notified UW Medicine. An investigation determined that the files became accessible about three weeks earlier on December 4 due to an employee error.
 
 Upon discovery, officials said they took steps to remove the exposed data from the site and removed saved information from all third-party sites.
 
 “Because Google had saved some of the files before December 26, 2018, UW Medicine worked with Google to remove the saved versions and prevent them from showing up in search results,” officials said in a statement. “All saved files were completely removed from Google’s servers by Jan. 10, 2019.”
 
 The exposed data included patient names, medical record numbers, the party who received the data, and a description and purpose of the information. For some, the files included the name of the lab test, but not the results, or the research study with the name of the health condition. No medical records, financial data, or Social Security numbers were breached.
 
 The database was used to keep track of when UW Medicine shared patient health information, which is require by HIPAA. According to officials, as required by state law, data sharing most commonly occurs with public health authorities, law enforcement and Child Protective Services.
 
 The provider also commonly shares the data “when a researcher receives approval to access medical records to determine whether a patient may be eligible for a research study or to recruit participants. The researcher must document in the database when they access the medical record.”
 
 The thorough breach notification also answered common questions as to why this data was kept and whether patients could remove their data from the server.
 
 “UW Medicine informs patients about how they share medical records in their Notice of Privacy Practices …. [and] only shares patient information when the law permits it,” officials said in a statement. “UW Medicine understands your concern. Due to state and federal regulations, these records must remain on file.”
 
 To prevent a similar breach in the future, officials said they’re reviewing protocols and procedures. The breach has been reported to the Office for Civil Rights.
 
 This is UW Medicine’s second breach in six years. In October 2013, the Social Security numbers and medical data of 90,000 patients were compromised when an employee opened an attachment containing malware. The virus took over the computer, which stored patient data.
 
 In 2015, the Washington provider settled with the Department of Health and Human Services for $750,000 over the breach. The HHS findings determined the provider lacked an effective risk assessment that would sufficiently address patient data risks and vulnerabilities.
 
 
 2. On Dec. 26, 2018, UW Medicine became aware of a vulnerability on a website server that made protected internal files available and visible by search on the internet on Dec. 4, 2018. The files contained protected health information (PHI) about reporting that UW Medicine is legally required to track, such as reporting to various regulatory bodies, in compliance with Washington state reporting requirements. 
 
 When we learned of the exposure of the files to the internet, we took immediate steps to remove the information from the site and initiated appropriate measures to remove saved information from any third-party sites. At this time, there is no evidence that there has been any misuse or attempted use of the information exposed in this incident.
 
 The files contained patients’ names, medical record numbers, and a description and purpose of the information. The files did not contain any medical records, patient financial information or Social Security numbers.
 
 Based on the results of our internal investigation, we are in the process of distributing letters to approximately 974,000 affected patients and have reported this incident to the Office for Civil Rights. Additionally, a trusted vendor, ID Experts, will manage a call center and website (https://ide.myidcare.com/uwmedicine) on behalf of UW Medicine beginning February 20. The call center hours are 5 a.m. to 5 p.m., Pacific Standard Time, Monday-Friday. The toll-free number is 844.322.8234.
 
 We regret that this incident occurred and sincerely apologize for any distress this may cause our patients and their families. UW Medicine is committed to providing quality care while protecting patients’ personal information. We are reviewing our internal protocols and procedures to prevent this from happening again.

2016,"Vail Clinic, INC dba Vail Valley Medical Center, and dba Howard Head Sports Medicine",CO,Unauthorized Disclosure,Laptop,"1. Vail Valley Medical Center (VVMC) is in the process of notifying 3,118 patients of the inappropriate disclosure of some of their protected health information (PHI).
 
 A physical therapist formerly employed at Howard Head Sports Medicine was discovered to have copied the PHI of patients and taken the data to his new employer. Prior to leaving employment, the physical therapist downloaded patient PHI onto a USB drive on two separate occasions.
 
 VVMC discovered the former employee’s HIPAA violations on February 16, 2016. An internal investigation revealed that the physical therapist had inappropriately accessed patient PHI and copied data on December 1, and December 30, 2015.
 
 No Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, bank account details, dates of birth, or addresses were taken, although the former employee did obtain patient names, patient ages, dates of service, amounts paid for medical services, and details of medical diagnoses, conditions, treatments, functional test outcomes, and progress information.
 
 Patients affected by the breach had previously attended the Vail Valley Medical Center or Howard Head Sports Medicine for treatment. VVMC contacted the former employee and requested the return of the stolen data and portable storage devices. Those devices have now been recovered and certification has been obtained confirming that no data have been retained, and copies have been securely destroyed. The Office for Civil Rights and law enforcement have been notified of the HIPAA violation and privacy breach. VVMC has advised patients to exercise caution and to check Explanation of Benefits statements for any sign of fraudulent activity.
 
 This type of HIPAA breach is not uncommon. When healthcare workers leave their employer and go to work for another healthcare provider many are tempted to take patient data with them. While it is difficult to prevent the theft of PHI, healthcare organizations can take a number of steps to reduce the risk of this happening and to ensure that any unauthorized copying of data is rapidly identified.
 
 In an effort to prevent this type of privacy breach from occurring in the future, VVMC has implemented tools that prevent the copying of patient data to portable storage devices and new controls are being developed that will make it easier for staff to monitor for inappropriate accessing of health records by employees. VVMC has also appointed a new member of staff to act as Health Information Manager. The main responsibilities of new role are to strengthen security controls and ensure that patient information is properly safeguarded. Further training has also been provided to staff members on HIPAA Rules and policies and procedures are being updated.

The center notified those patients with a letter dated July 17, though some people didn't receive the letter until Tuesday.
 
 According to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Journal, the computer was password protected and there is ""no evidence that the hard drive has been inappropriately accessed.''
 
 Doug Murphy, a Wappingers resident, said he and his wife received the letter Tuesday.
 
 ""Why did it take two weeks to get to me'' and ""Why are Social Security numbers on laptops; shouldn't they be on a hard drive in someone's office, not a laptop where someone can walk out the door with it?'' he asked.
 
 The laptop was used as part of a disaster drill May 21 and had the hospital's master patient index on it, said Florie Munroe, chief compliance officer for Vassar Brothers. It was one of several machines throughout the hospital that had this data downloaded as part of the drill, she said.
 
 The thought was that in a disaster, the hospital would need to function without access to its network, spokeswoman Jeanine Agnolet said.
 
 Since the theft was reported June 26, the data on the other machines has been erased, said Dave Ping, vice president of strategic planning and business development.
 
 The laptop computer is used to gather initial patient information at people's bedsides. It was secured by a cable lock to a mobile cart in the emergency department.
 
 City and state police were notified of the theft June 26, Munroe said.
 
 The computer has not been located, though security videotapes have been reviewed.
 
 One reason for the delay in notifying patients was to make sure only those patients whose identities may have been compromised were sent a letter, Munroe said.
 
 There were other names in the database, but they had no personally-identifying information associated with them. They may have had a medical data number or other incomplete data, she said.
 
 ""The 257,800 people contacted had personally identifying information (in the database) which pointed to individuals and could be misued,'' she said.",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,23.0,257800.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2018,VCU Health System,VA,Unauthorized Disclosure,Electronic Medical Record,"1. Investigation indicates no malicious intent
 
 RICHMOND — VCU Health System is notifying about 4,700 individuals that their or their minor child’s electronic health information was inappropriately accessed. There is no indication that the private health information has been or will be used for any malicious purposes.
 
 The matter came to light on May 9, when an unusual pattern of accessing electronic health information was detected.
 
 Following an investigation and review of access audit logs, the health system confirmed that an employee accessed, without legitimate business reasons, information about patients and services they received at the VCU Health System. As a result of this incident, the employee has been terminated.
 
 The inappropriate access happened generally during the employee’s employment between Jan. 3, 2003 and May 10, 2018. The investigation indicated the electronic health information was viewed without malicious intent. However, it is the VCU Health System’s responsibility to notify affected patients that the incidents happened.
 
 Information that may have been viewed includes the patients’ full names, home addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, health care providers, visit dates, health insurance information and other medical information. In some instances, Social Security numbers also could have been viewed.
 
 VCU Health System is staffing a toll-free line for patient questions at (877) 846-9080, Mondays through Fridays, from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. The health system also is providing one year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to assist patients whose Social Security numbers were accessed. Instructions have been provided to all affected patients for placing a fraud alert, freezing a credit file, obtaining a free credit report and protecting health information.
 
 2. Former VCU Health System Employee Accessed PHI of 4,686 Patients Without Authorization
 VCU Health System in Virginia has discovered one of its employees accessed the protected health information of thousands of patients without authorization. The data breach was discovered on May 9, 2018, when an unusual pattern of electronic medical record activity was discovered.
 
 A full review of the employee’s EHR access logs confirmed the unauthorized accessing of patients’ health information. The employee joined VCU Health System on January 3, 2003 and was terminated for inappropriate PHI access on May 10, 2018. During that period, the protected health information of 4,686 patients was accessed with no legitimate work reason for doing so.
 
 The types of information the employee was able to view included patients’ names, addresses, birthdates, medical record numbers, healthcare providers, health insurance information, visit dates, and medical information. Some patients’ Social Security numbers may also have been viewed.
 
 VCU Health System does not believe the records were accessed with any malicious intent, only out of curiosity. Patients whose Social Security numbers were potentially viewed have been offered 12 months of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services without charge.
 
 HIPAA requires healthcare organizations to conduct periodic reviews of EHR access logs. It is therefore unclear why it took so long for the unauthorized access to be discovered.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,126.0,4686.0,468600.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

2017,Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Health System,VA,HACK,Other,"1. For the past three years, the electronic medical records of patients of Virginia Commonwealth University Health System have been inappropriately accessed by employees of physician groups.
 
 In total, around 2,700 individuals, many of whom were children, have had their medical records viewed and their privacy violated.
 
 VCU Health System provides access to patients’ medical records to community physician groups and contracted vendors. Community physicians are able to share patients’ medical records with the VCU Health System to ensure continuity of care when referring patients. Contractors that provide medical equipment to patients are similarly given access to medical records.
 
 However, VCU Health System discovered ‘an unusual pattern of accessing medical records’ in January. Further investigation revealed individuals were accessing patients’ medical records without any legitimate business reason for doing so and that records had been accessed for a period of more than three years. The first privacy breach occurred on January 3, 2014 and inappropriate access continued until January 10, 2017, when the privacy breaches were discovered. The records were accessed by a contractor and employees of some community physician groups that were partnered with Virginia Commonwealth University Health System.
 
 The types of information accessed includes names, addresses, medical record numbers, birth dates, visit dates, health care provider names, health insurance details, medical information and some patients’ Social Security numbers.
 
 According to a statement released by VCU Health System, the investigation did not uncover any evidence to suggest that health insurance information had been used inappropriately and no information appears to have been accessed with malicious intent.
 
 VCU Health System determined which individuals had improperly accessed patients’ medical records and employers terminated those employees. In order to prevent similar breaches from occurring in the future, VCU Health System has implemented new safeguards to prevent inappropriate system access. All individuals impacted by the privacy breaches have been offered complimentary credit monitoring services for 12 months without charge.
 
 The incident highlights how important it is for controls to be put in place to prevent the inappropriate accessing of medical records and for regular audits of PHI access logs to be conducted. It may not always be possible to prevent inappropriate accessing of medical records by employees, partners and business associates, but fast identification of privacy violations will allow healthcare organizations to take action to limit the harm caused.
 
 2. Virginia Commonwealth University Health System is notifying about 2,700 people that their or their minor child’s electronic medical records were inappropriately accessed over a three-year period. The university said it has no indication that the private health information has been used for any unintended purposes.
 
 The breach was found Jan. 10 when an unusual pattern of accessing electronic medical records was detected.
 
 An investigation found that employees of some community physician groups and an employee of a contracted vendor accessed, without legitimate business reasons, information about services patients received at the VCU Health System. As a result of the incidents, the respective employers terminated those employees.
 
 As part of the health system’s partnership with community physicians , access is provided to their practices so they can view the medical records of their patients who are referred to the VCU Health System for care and treatment. Access also is provided to certain contracted vendors who provide medical equipment to patients for continuity of care at discharge from the hospital.
 
 The inappropriate access occurred generally between Jan. 3, 2014, and Jan. 10, 2017. The investigation indicated the electronic medical records were viewed without malicious intent and no information was inappropriately used. VCU Health System said it has instituted new safeguards to prevent inappropriate access to the system.
 
 Information that may have been viewed includes the patient’s name, home address, date of birth, medical record number, health care provider, visit dates, health insurance information and medical information.

 What Are Critical Considerations in Risk Management?
 This event was determined by HCA as a HIPAA violation due to the Privacy Rule violation. Furthermore, because HCA was unable to prove that the information was not spread beyond the state systems, it categorized the incident as a healthcare data breach, and is following through as such.
 
 “While we have no indication that the client files went beyond the two individuals involved, Important privacy laws were violated and we are exercising caution and due diligence given the nature of the information,” said HCA’s risk manager Steve Dotson.
 
 Both individuals involved had their employment terminated. HCA also sent HIPAA data breach notification letters to all potentially affected individuals, per the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

 This was reported by James Haggerty on January 23, but I just stumbled across it now:
 A compact disc including information on Medicare patients at Wayne Memorial Hospital disappeared recently en route to its intended recipient.
 
 An administrator at Wayne Memorial in Honesdale on Nov. 28 sent the unencrypted disc and related paperwork by certified mail to the Pittsburgh office of Novitas Solutions Inc., a Camp Hill-based Medicare administrative contractor, the hospital reported.
 
 Although it was mailed in a legal envelope, Wayne Memorial officials say it arrived at Novitas’s Pittsburgh offices in a cardboard box without the disc. They were notified Dec. 3 that the disc was missing.
 
 Hospital officials suspect the original package was damaged at a postal facility, the disc was lost and the paperwork was inserted into another package, which was delivered to Novitas.
 
 The disc contained the names of 1,182 people who had been Medicare patients at the Honesdale hospital between 2007 and 2012 and have account balances outstanding, hospital spokeswoman Lisa Champeau said. Most of the patients’ Medicare account numbers were included on the disc, she said.

 The CD was included in a package sent by certified mail to WMH’s government authorized Medicare Administrative Contractor. The contractor received the package damaged and without the CD. Upon learning this, WMH conducted a diligent search for the CD with both the United States Post Office and the contractor. To date, WMH has been unable to locate the CD. The investigation confirmed that the CD contained names of patients who used WMH services between 2007 and 2012, account balances and, in some instances, Medicare numbers.
 
 WMH administrators said they have no reason to believe that any of the information has been accessed or used improperly. However, in an abundance of caution, the Hospital has established a dedicated call center for those affected. WMH is also offering to eligible individuals one year of credit monitoring services provided through Experian. More information can be found at the WMH website at www.wmh.org.

2016,Wentworth-Douglass Hospital,NH,DISC,Other,"Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover, New Hampshire has started alerting patients to a privacy breach experienced by one of its vendors, Ambucor Health Solutions.
 
 Ambucor Health Solutions provides a remote-monitoring service for cardiac devices for hospitals throughout the United States. Earlier this month, the company started notifying its clients of a privacy breach caused by one of its former employees.
 
 Prior to leaving employment, the employee downloaded sensitive company data onto two flash drives. The data breach was discovered by Ambucor Health Solutions over the summer and an investigation was launched.
 
 The incident was reported to law enforcement, and the subsequent investigation resulted in the flash drives being recovered in July.
 
 An analysis of the contents of the drives, which was completed in September, revealed the downloaded data included a range of electronic health information of cardiac patients from a number of the company’s clients, and included the protected health information of 775 patients of Wentworth-Douglass Hospital.
 
 Social Security numbers, financial information, insurance information, and Medicare/Medicaid numbers were not copied to the flash drives so Wentworth-Douglass Hospital believes the risk of data being used to make fraudulent claims or steal identities is low. No evidence has been uncovered by law enforcement, Ambucor Health Solutions, nor Wentworth-Douglass Hospital to suggest any of the downloaded data have been used inappropriately.
 
 However, out of an abundance of caution, all affected patients have been offered 12 months of identity theft protection services without charge. Patients will also be protected by a $1 million identity theft insurance policy.
 
 The protected health information copied to the device included names, phone numbers, home address, race, Ambucor enrollment numbers, Ambucor enrollment dates, Ambucor technician names, patient ID numbers, Physicians’ names, testing data, medications, medical diagnoses, names of the practices visited, and details of the cardiac devices that had been fitted.
 
 Ambucor Health Solutions has since taken steps to improve security to prevent future breaches of this nature from occurring, including conducting a thorough review and update of all HIPAA policies covering data security.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ ----------------------------------------------------------------------@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ DOVER — Ambucor Health Solutions, a remote monitoring service for cardiac devices used by Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, has experienced a privacy breach involving WDH patients.
 
 Ambucor discovered recently that thumb drives recovered from one of its former employees contained personal information of thousands of patients nationwide, including 775 WDH patients.
 
 The personal information did not include Social Security numbers or credit card, insurance, Medicaid/Medicare or other financial information.
 
 The personal information may have included patient’s name, date of birth, home address, phone number, medications, race, testing data, patient identification number, medical device information such as the manufacturer, diagnosis, Ambucor enrollment number, Ambucor enrollment date, Ambucor technician name, physician name(s), and the name and address of the practice where the patient was seen.
 
 While WDH was not directly involved in the breach, it appreciates the importance of protecting the privacy and security of personal information and deeply regrets any inconvenience or concern this incident may cause its patients. Ambucor officials are cooperating with federal investigators and have confirmed they are taking steps to prevent this type of incident from occurring again, including a thorough review of and updates to all HIPAA security processes.
 
 There is no indication that any personal data has been misused. However, out of an abundance of caution, according to a hospital statement, Ambucor has offered affected patients one year of identity protection services and, if necessary, related recovery services and $1 million of identity theft insurance at no cost. Patients who were affected by this matter have received a letter from Ambucor with further information about how to activate the free identity protection services.
 
 Ambucor discovered the breach while investigating activities of a former employee shortly before his employment ended. Ambucor determined that the former employee had downloaded information from a company-issued computer to thumb drives. In a related investigation, federal law enforcement authorities provided Ambucor with two thumb drives turned over by the former employee.
 
 Ambucor discovered in July 2016 that the thumb drives likely contained patient data. In September 2016, after completing a detailed review of forensic and other information, Ambucor was able to determine that personal data on the drives was patient data.

 While the data did not include Social Security numbers, credit card, insurance, Medicaid/Medicare or other financial information, some personal data may have been exposed.
 
 This includes patients’ names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, medications, race, testing data, patient identification numbers, medical device information such as the manufacturer, diagnosis, Ambucor enrollment numbers, Ambucor enrollment dates, Ambucor technician names, physician name(s), and the name and address of the practice where the patient was seen.
 
 There is no indication that the data has been misused, but Ambucor has offered affected patients one year of identity protection services. Furthermore, Ambucor will also offer any necessary related recovery services and $1 million of identity theft insurance.
 
 In the original breach, Ambucor had an employee who downloaded GHS information not long before his employment at Ambucor ended. The business associate was given two flash drives in July from law enforcement, which had been turned in when the employee left. Upon learning that information had been downloaded, Ambucor started to notify those potentially affected.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,120.0,775.0,77500.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 We take the privacy and security of our patients’ information very seriously. This notice is to
 inform our patients of an incident that may have involved some of that information.
 On February 7, 2019, we determined that there may have been unauthorized access to some of our
 employees’ email accounts in October 2018. We conducted an investigation, which included hiring
 a leading third party forensic firm to determine how the incident occurred and what information
 was contained in the email accounts. The investigation indicated that some patient information
 was contained in the email accounts, and may have included patients’ names, dates of birth, health
 insurance information and information related to care patients received at our hospital. In some
 limited instances, social security numbers and driver’s license numbers were also included in the
 email accounts.
 We began mailing letters to affected patients on April 8, 2019. If you believe you have been
 affected by this incident or have any questions, please call 1-866-340-0318, Monday through
 Friday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. MT.
 While we have no indication that any of our patients’ information has been misused, we
 recommend patients review the statements they receive from their health insurer. If they see
 charges for services they did not receive, please contact the insurer immediately. For the limited
 number of patients whose social security numbers or driver’s license numbers were impacted, we
 are offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services.

2019,West Hills Hospital & Medical Center,CA,HACK,Network Server,"West Hills Hospital & Medical Center (“West Hills”) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of patient information, and as part of this commitment, we are making individuals aware of a recent incident that may have impacted their personal information.
 
 What happened?
 West Hills has utilized a company called United WestLabs, Inc. (“UWL”) to manage our reference laboratory. We recently became aware that American Medical Collection Agency (“AMCA”), a collection services agency that UWL and West Hills have used for patient collections services, experienced a security incident affecting one of its web servers. AMCA reported the incident to law enforcement, secured the affected server and conducted an internal investigation. AMCA’s investigation showed that as a result of the security incident, an unauthorized user accessed the server between August 1, 2018 and March 30, 2019.
 
 On June 12, 2019, we became aware from UWL that the AMCA security incident affected certain individuals who either received or were financially responsible for laboratory services performed at West Hills’ reference laboratory. UWL and West Hills immediately began an investigation into the issue and stopped using AMCA’s services.
 
 What information was involved?
 As a result of the AMCA security incident, the following types of information pertaining to affected individuals may have been accessed: name, home address, amount owed for laboratory testing services, date of such services, and patient account numbers. Individuals for whom a debit/credit card number or bank account information was affected may have received a separate notification from AMCA. AMCA’s servers did not include, and therefore the unauthorized user did not have access to, Social Security numbers.
 
 What we are doing
 Upon learning of this issue, West Hills immediately began an investigation and confirmed that UWL had ceased sending patient accounts to AMCA. West Hills and UWL notified all affected individuals by mail.
 
 What you can do
 Although we do not have reason to believe that patient or other personal information has been or will be misused, we advise that affected individuals remain vigilant for incidents of fraud and identity theft by regularly reviewing financial account statements and explanation of benefits and monitoring free credit reports for any unauthorized activity. If affected individuals discover any suspicious or unusual activity on their accounts, they should immediately notify their financial institution(s).",1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,300.0,10650.0,1065000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2013,West Kendall Baptist Hospital,FL,INSD,Other,"Miami resident Cristobal Raul Puig was sentenced to 31 months in federal prison yesterday for his role in a Baptist Health South Florida tax fraud scheme.
 
 According to justice.gov, Puig had previously pled guilty to one count of possessing 15 or more Social Security numbers of other persons that he paired with names and dates of birth for one count of attempting to impersonate another person. Puig had acquired the hospital patient names, dates of birth, social security numbers and addresses from a Baptist Health System’s West Kendall employee.
 
 Puig then used the patient data (he was in possession of a list of 20 total) to file unauthorized income tax returns. He was also arrested in 2012 for theft. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurice A. Johnson.
 
 Baptist Health also owns South Miami Hospital, which has experienced its own breach troubles of late. Florida in general is having serious problems with patient data security and perhaps this sentence will deter would-be hackers and thieves from stealing patient data.

 Foundations Recovery Network, headquartered in Nashville, Tenn., alerted an unknown number of patients that an employee laptop containing patient names, dates of birth, addresses, telephone numbers and Social Security numbers had been stolen. The device was password-protected but there didn’t appear to be any technical safeguards such as encryption. Here is the organization’s breach notification letter:
 
 I am writing on behalf of Foundations Recovery Network to inform you of a recent privacy incident concerning your personal information. On Saturday, June 15, one of our employees informed us that she had been the victim of a burglary during the early morning hours on June 15 at approximately 2:45 a.m. and that her company laptop had been stolen. The laptop contained certain aspects of patient information which she needed as part of her role with our company. The employee reported the theft immediately to law enforcement authorities. We understand that the theft was one of several that took place in her neighborhood that night, so we do not believe the thief specifically targeted her or the laptop.
 
 At this time, we do not know whether the information on the laptop has been accessed. It is important to note that the information is password protected. However, because the safety and security of your information is our utmost priority, we wanted to contact you out of an abundance of caution and make you aware of the situation. The potentially disclosed information may include your personal information (such as name, date of birth, address, telephone number and social security number) and medical information (such as diagnosis — the majority of which were listed in numeric medical code only, level of care, date of service, and health insurance information). We
 sincerely regret that this incident occurred.
 
 Even though we have no reason to believe that your information has been accessed by anyone outside our organization at this time, and we do not believe any of your financial information is included on the stolen laptop, we want to make sure you are aware of the incident and have resources available to protect your personal information. Therefore, we have contracted with Experian to provide to you a free one year membership in Experian’ se ProtectMyIDe Alert.

This is the second large data breach reported in Illinois this year, according to HHS data.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ ----------------------------------------------------------------------@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ The bitter fight to keep open Westlake Hospital has some questioning if Illinois will see more closures end up in court now that state regulators have gained more control over health care facilities.
 
 Local politicians and community groups have opposed Pipeline Health at every turn since the company bought Westlake, Weiss Memorial Hospital and West Suburban Medical Center at the end of January.
 
 The new owners promised to keep services open at Westlake in Melrose Park for least two years in documents submitted to the Illinois Health Facilities and Service Review Board. But weeks after Pipeline assumed ownership it announced plans to close Westlake.
 
 The review board approved the closure in April, but a Cook County judge in early May ordered Westlake to stay open while that approval was reviewed. Then the hospital operator filed bankruptcy Aug. 6 in Delaware.
 
 On Tuesday, Westlake’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy was transferred to Chicago. And on Wednesday, a Cook County judge is expected to rule if Westlake operators violated her order to keep the hospital open.
 
 Until a few weeks ago, hospital closures were generally straightforward in Illinois. Facility operators applied for closure with state regulators, and as long as all of the necessary documents were in order, the board approved the closure.
 
 The battle over Westlake changed that.
 
 State Rep. Kathleen Willis, D-Northlake, whose district includes Westlake Hospital, helped lead an effort to change how hospital closures are handled. Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the changes into law in July.",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1.0,686.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2007,West Penn Allegheny Health System,PA,PORT,Other,"The West Penn Allegheny Health System is informing about 42,000 people who have been home care or hospice patients that they may be at risk for identity theft.
 
 Their personal information was contained on a laptop computer that was stolen with other items during a home burglary Nov. 24, system officials announced yesterday. The computer was taken from the residence of a home care nurse.
 
 The computer contained personal information dating to about 2000 for current or former patients of the Western Pennsylvania Hospital and Allegheny General Hospital home care departments and the Forbes hospice program, said health system spokesman Tom Chakurda.
 
 ""Examples of data on the computer when it was stolen include patient names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers and patient care histories,"" officials said in a letter sent Saturday to those whose information was believed to be on the computer.
 
 The letter said the employee ""had the computer at her home for work-related reasons.""
 
 Mr. Chakurda emphasized that only people served by the home care and hospice programs may be involved, not the larger population of patients served by the hospital system.
 
 In the letter, officials said the computer was still on when it was stolen and the data were accessible. They said once the machine was turned off, the data would be protected and could not be accessed.
 
 ""We are not aware of any inappropriate use of your information at this time and we currently believe the likelihood of such misuse is low,"" the letter noted.
 
 The health system is examining other steps that could be taken to improve computer security, he said.
 
 The letter provided instructions on how patients could place a fraud alert on their credit files and obtain free credit reports. The health system also is offering a year of free credit monitoring.

 Teresa McCabe, vice president of Marketing and Development, said during Panhandle Live on WEPM Radio in Martinsburg Monday the breach was not an instance of hacking and that the employee was able to circumvent checks built into the system to prevent this type of incident.
 
 “That was the scope of her job,” McCabe said. “To be in that part of the medical record and access that information.”
 
 McCabe said the employee passed background checks when hired in 2014.
 
 University Healthcare’s Legal Counsel Garland Naggy said they would be looking at those procedures to make sure this type of breach could not happen in the future, and reiterated it was not a failure of technology or negligence that led to the incident.
 
 “This was an individual who, her job, the scope of it was to take in individuals’ demographic information,” Naggy said. “She then chose to do a criminal act, which was to take that information and write it down on a piece of paper and take it home with her.”

2005,Wilcox Memorial Hospital,HI,PORT,Other,"The Social Security numbers of 130,000 former and current Wilcox Memorial Hospital patients have been lost due to the disappearance of a back-up computer data drive, a hospital spokesperson said.
 
 The drive was reported missing on Wednesday, Oct. 5, according to Lani Yukimura, marketing director for Wilcox Health (Wilcox Memorial Hospital and Kauai Medical Clinic).
 
 The data refers only to hospital patients, and does not include medical information, but does include names, addresses, medical record numbers and, as mentioned, Social Security numbers. The data file goes back 12 years, according to Yukimura.
 
 Hospital officials are concerned about potential identity theft, should the computer drive, which is much smaller than a cellular telephone, fall into the wrong hands.
 
 Yukimura said 130,000 letters dated Monday, Oct. 17, and signed by Kathy Clark RN, chief operating officer of Wilcox Memorial Hospital, have been sent out to patients whose information is lost and might be compromised.
 
 Yukimura said no one is certain what happened to the backup data, which was stored on a “thumb drive.”
 
 She said Wilcox officials, un-like hospitals in California, are not required by law to divulge that the data is missing, but did so voluntarily to protect patients.
 
 “We have no indication anyone has used this information. It is missing, and we want people to know about it,” she said.
 
 Yukimura said Kaua’i Police Department (KPD) officers have been contacted, and an in-house investigation is also proceeding.
 
 Yukimura said the data on the drive was not encrypted, and is readable with Adobe Acrobat Reader.
 
 “While our systems are extremely secure, our employees are trained and we have procedures in place, this incident showed us that we need to have clearer policies on both encryption as well as access to back-up data,” she said.
 
 “We have discontinued the use of thumb drives for this type of information storage.”
 
 The thumb drive is the world’s first and smallest portable storage drive. It plugs directly into the USB port of any computer, and can store virtually any digital data from documents and presentations, and can fit on a key chain or in a pocket, according to Internet information.
 
 Hawaii Pacific Health (HPH) Information Security and Privacy Officer David Fox said hospital leaders are still considering whether or not they would contact FBI officials. He said HPH and Wilcox officials were still weighing liability issues, and other authorities they might be obligated to contact.
 
 HPH is the parent organization of Wilcox Memorial Hospital and the Kauai Medical Clinic. No KMC data has been breached.
 
 Fox said Wilcox officials waited 12 days from the discovery of the drive being missing to the issuance of the letters in order to make sure the thumb drive was in fact missing, so as to not unduly alarm patients in the event the drive was found.
 
 “We didn’t want to sit on it any longer based upon the respect we have for the patients, and the risk it could potentially create,” he said.
 
 Yukimura said hospital officials would not reveal what department this occurred in, or who was in charge.
 
 “It is inappropriate to comment on the specifics related to any individuals that may be involved. What we can say is that our ongoing internal review and work with KPD has not turned up anything.”
 
 Yukimura said the thumb drive is usually stored in a secure area.
 
 “It was also being used within that secure area, and the discovery that it was missing was also made within that secure area,” Yukimura said.
 
 “We sincerely regret that this incident occurred, and we are doing everything we can to remedy the situation,” she continued.
 
 “We are letting people know because we feel they should be made aware of the possibility that the information can be misused. We have no indication that the information has been or will be misused, and we’re still hoping that the missing drive will be located.”
 
 In her letter, Clark wrote: “We take information security and the responsibility of protecting our patient information seriously. We have many safeguards and processes in place, however this incident has prompted us to take even further precautions and protective measures.” @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It seems like every week there’s news of another security breach at a company holding sensitive consumer information, putting more Americans at risk of identity theft. Thousands of companies maintain files with detailed financial and personal information about consumers, including Social Security numbers, birth dates, account numbers, and addresses. This information is the key that crooks can use to get credit in someone else’s name and steal identities.
 
 To date, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse estimates that over 93 million sensitive records have been put at risk as a result of these breaches. Here are some recent examples of companies and other institutions whose security has been breached and others that have come under fire for failing to maintain strict security practices:
 
 February 2005, Choicepoint, Inc.: In mid-February 2005, ChoicePoint, Inc., an information broker based in Georgia, announced that a fraud ring had gained access to the personal and financial information of an estimated 145,000 consumers from computer databases maintained by the company. ChoicePoint maintains a huge database with billions of records on consumers culled from public records and other documents. It sells access to that information to businesses for a variety of purposes. The ChoicePoint files that were compromised contained such sensitive information as Social Security numbers matched to names and addresses. Subsequent news reports indicated that ChoicePoint had experienced similar security breaches in the past.
 
 February 2005, Bank of America: An estimated 1.2 million federal workers were put at risk of identity theft as result of lost computer tapes maintained by Bank of America. The bank announced in late February the loss of the tapes, which included Social Security numbers, addresses and credit account numbers. A Bank of America spokesperson indicated that the tapes were probably stolen by baggage handlers from a commercial airplane when they were being shipped to a back-up data center. Members of Congress were among those federal workers whose information was put at risk as a result of the lost tapes.
 
 February 2005, Westlaw: This Minnesota-based data search company was criticized in early 2005 for maintaining loose security practices that enabled clients who used the firm’s online “People-Find” database to obtain Social Security numbers and other personal information. Private companies subscribe to this service, giving them easy access to sensitive information that can be used to commit identity theft. A Senator exposed the lax security maintained on the web site and called on the company to disable it until better security was established to prevent fraud. Westlaw responded to the complaints by announcing that it would restrict customer access to Social Security numbers.
 
 February 2005, PayMaxx: This payroll processing company was in the news recently after a computer security expert revealed how easy it was to obtain personal information, including Social Security numbers, from the firm’s web site. Aaron Greenspan of Think Computer Corporation contacted the company when he discovered that a software glitch enabled any user to view the W-2 forms generated for employees of companies that use PayMaxx. The company has since taken action to correct the problem.
 
 March 2005, Lexis Nexis: In early March 2005, Lexis-Nexis announced that the security of a database maintained by a company it owns had been compromised, leaving another 32,000 people at risk of having their identities stolen and credit ruined. In April, Lexis-Nexis acknowledged that it had underestimated the size of the breach by almost ten times. The company now says that the personal information of 310,000 people was compromised by crooks who obtained passwords from legitimate customers and accessed such information as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and drivers’ license numbers. The files were part of a database maintained by Seisint, which is owned by Lexis-Nexis. The company sells access to the data to a variety of business and government clients.
 
 March 2005, DSW Shoe Warehouse: Retail Ventures, Inc. announced in early March that credit card account numbers and other information about customers of 103 DSW Shoe Warehouse stores had been stolen from company computer database. DSW initially estimated that about 100,000 records were lost. However, in April, DSW found that the breach was much worse than that: the credit card numbers of about 1.4 million customers, and the driver’s license information of about 96,000 customers, had been accessed by thieves. DSW initially was made aware of the problem by credit card companies that noticed suspicious activity on some of the affected accounts.
 
 March 2005, Boston College: In March, Boston College informed 120,000 alumni that a computer containing their addresses and Social Security numbers had been breached by hackers. The breach was discovered by a computer security worker who found that a computer at a phone bank had been compromised.
 
 March 2005, University of California, Berkeley: In October 2004, the University of California announced that the names, addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security numbers and birthdates of 1.4 million people had been compromised. The university obtained the information from the California Department of Social Services’ In-Home Supportive Services program, for the purposes of research. The breach was discovered by the information technology staff at the university, using intrusion-detection software.
 
 April 2005, Ameritrade: Ameritrade Holding Corp., a top online discount broker, announced in April 2005 that it lost a backup tape during shipping between vendors. The tape contained the personal information of about 200,000 current and former customers and may have included Social Security numbers. Ameritrade discovered the loss of the tape in February, when it received a damaged envelope containing backup tapes. An investigation revealed that four tapes were missing, but only three have been recovered.
 
 April 2005, GeneralMotors Mastercard: In April, HSBC, the bank that issues the GM Rewards Mastercard, notified 180,000 customers that their cards had been used at an anonymous retailer during the period between June 2002 and December 2004. HSBC provided a toll-free number and the investigation is ongoing.
 
 May 2005, Omega World Travel: In May 2005, US police authorities announced their investigation regarding the theft of a computer containing the private information of 80,000 Justice Department employees. The computer contained password-protected names and credit card account numbers, as well as employee traveler profiles which may include home addresses, telephone numbers, even passport numbers.
 
 May 2005, Time Warner: Adding another occurrence to the number of cases involving data storage tapes lost in transit, Time Warner announced on May 2 the loss of tapes containing the information of 600,000 current and former employees. Time Warner is the largest media company in the world, and owns American Online, HBO and Warner Brother. The missing tapes include employee information from as far back as 1986 and the United States Secret Service is currently investigating this matter.
 
 May 2005, Colorado State Health Department: In late May 2005, a Colorado state health department employee took a laptop – containing the medical records of 1,600 families – home for the weekend and left it in a car overnight, where it was stolen. The employee, who violated department policy by removing the laptop, containing the medical records, from the facility, has been demoted. The car has been recovered, but the laptop is still missing. The department has since upgraded its encryption software and begun to re-examine its confidentiality procedures, and the car, though not the laptop, has been recovered.
 
 June 2005, CitiFinancial: In June 2005, CitiFinancial began mailing notices to the 3.9 million customers whose private information was put at risk when backup tapes containing their information were lost in transit. The tapes contained information about network branch customers in the US, as well as customers with closed, CitiFinancial Retail Services, accounts. This breach occurred despite the “enhanced” security procedures that CitiFinancial claims to have in place and, beginning in July, all such data will be encrypted.
 
 June 2005, Motorola: In June, Motorola sent emails to its employees, approximately 34,000 of whom are in the US, notifying them of the theft of two computers from the offices of Motorola’s human resources services provider, Affiliated Computer Sources. The stolen computers contained the names and Social Security Numbers of an undisclosed number of employees. Motorola reported the incident to police (who are currently investigating the thefts) and is providing free fraud insurance to employees.
 
 June 2005, CardSystems: A record 40 million credit card holders throughout the United States may have had their credit card numbers stolen after a hacker infiltrated a major third-party payment processor’s database in late 2004. CardSystems Solutions Inc., a Tucson, Ariz. based company said that a hacker infiltrated the company’s computer network to access financial information for millions of consumers carrying MasterCard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other brands of credit cards. The breach has been characterized as one of the largest security blunders ever to occur in terms of the number of potential victims. It was discovered after a MasterCard investigation revealed a link between numerous fraudulent transactions that CardSystems had handled.
 
 June 2005, University of Hawaii: University of Hawaii officials fear that up to 150,000 users of its library system may be at risk of identity theft after discovering that a former university employee who had access to tens of thousands of Social Security numbers had been indicted of identity theft and fraud. While it is unclear if the ex-employee, Deborah Jenkins misused the private information the library uses, Jenkins and her husband have been accused of using a Maryland man’s identity to co-sign on tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. Her husband was arrested in Florida in early 2005; Jenkins is still on the loose. University officials encouraged the affected library patrons to keep a close eye on their credit records.
 
 July 2005, University of Southern California: In late April 2006, federal prosecutors charged a San Diego man with hacking into the University of Southern California’s admissions website and stealing the personal information for several applicants in June 2005. The hacker, 25-year old Eric McCarty said that he earned money for exposing security vulnerabilities on secure websites and wrote about how he hacked into USC’s servers on an internet-security website. McCarty later reported the vulnerability to the school. The university took its admissions site offline for two weeks after discovering that the programming flaw could allow outsiders to access its database containing Social Security numbers and birthdates for more than a 270,000 prospective students who applied at the prestigious university between 1997 and 2005.
 
 August 2005, University of Utah: The University of Utah reported that a hacker gained access to a database of 100,000 employee names and Social Security numbers on one of the school’s servers and may have downloaded them. The University encouraged anyone who worked at the school between 1970 and 2003 to keep a watchful eye on their credit records. At least one former employee has come forward saying that a fraudulent purchase was made using his credit card. The employee suspects that whoever made the purchase obtained his private information from the breached school server.
 
 September 2005, Kent State University: Numerous desktop computers containing names, Social Security numbers and student grades for 100,000 students and faculty at Kent State University in Ohio were stolen in Sept. 2005. The university sent out e-mails alerting the campus of the thefts and warned about the potential for identity theft. A university spokesman said that the computer was password protected, but did not make it clear whether the information was encrypted.
 
 October 2005, Wilcox Memorial Hospital: 130,000 former and current patients at Hawaii’s Wilcox Memorial Hospital were warned after a computer drive with their names, addresses, medical record numbers and Social Security numbers disappeared in Oct. 2005. A hospital spokesman said that the unencrypted information was contained on a small USB memory drive and is in a highly accessible PDF format. Hospital officials waited 12 days before notifying patients after unsuccessfully trying to locate the drive within a “secure area” of the medical facility. Hawaii state laws do not require companies to notify consumers after their private information has been compromised, but Wilcox voluntarily sent notification letters to affected patients. It is unclear if the drive has been recovered.
 
 November 2005, Boeing: A laptop with sensitive data such as names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, and financial information was stolen from a Boeing human-resources employee in Nov. 2005. The crook took private information for 161,000 current and former employees of the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer. A company spokesman said that the laptop was password protected but the data was not encrypted. Boeing is enrolling employees in a credit-monitoring service free of charge and will assist in the registration with the three credit-reporting agencies.
 
 December 2005, Firstrust Bank: A man disguised as a janitor made his way into a Northeastern Philadelphia bank and stole a laptop containing account information and Social Security numbers for 100,000 customers in early Nov. 2005. The institution, Firstrust Bank, frustrated its customers after waiting nearly a month before issuing a warning about the theft. Firstrust and authorities said that the computer was password protected and that they were not sure if the thief was specifically looking for the private information.
 
 December 2005, Marriott International: Officials at Marriott International’s Orlando office don’t know whether computer back-up tapes containing credit card information and Social Security numbers of 206,000 of its time-share owners and employees went lost or was stolen, a company spokesman said in late December 2005. The tapes have been missing since mid-November, but Marriott began sending out letters to affected individuals and public outreach a little more than a month after the disappearance. The hotel chain said that special equipment is required to access the information contained on the disks. They were not aware if there had been any misuse of the missing information and offered free credit monitoring services to affected parties.
 
 January 2006, Providence Home Services: Ten disks containing unencrypted names, addresses, medical records, and in some cases, financial information for 365,000 Providence Home Services customers were stolen from an employee’s personal automobile on Dec. 31, 2005. A significant number of the records also contained Social Security numbers. The Pacific Northwest-based healthcare provider said that the employee had taken the disks home “as part of a backup process intended to guarantee access to critical information in case of an emergency at our primary offices.” The company waited nearly a month before contacting at-risk customers saying that it needed the extended period of time to identify what information had been stolen.
 
 January 2006, The Boston Globe & The Worcester Telegram & Gazette: As many as 240,000 subscribers to The Boston Globe and its sister publication The Worcester Telegram & Gazette were potentially exposed to identity theft after documents containing bank routing numbers, credit card information and debit card numbers were used to wrap bundles of newspapers. The bundles were distributed to thousands of local retailers in the Boston area in late January 2006. The information was mistakenly released after print-outs containing the sensitive information were recycled to bundle the newspapers instead of being properly shredded. Publisher Richard H. Gilman apologized for the mistake and set up a hotline for subscribers to call to learn if their personal financial data was accidentally released. So far, there have been no reports of identity theft resulting from the release of the information.
 
 March 2006, Los Angeles County Department of Social Services: An investigation by KNBC-TV, the NBC station in Los Angeles, revealed that boxes upon boxes of personal information including social security numbers, W-2 forms and medical records were left unattended in a southland parking garage for months by the Los Angeles County Department of Social Services. The documents were ordered to be shredded by an outside contractor, but ended up sitting outside an unlocked dumpster in the department’s parking structure. The director of the department, Bryce Yokomizo, said that there was no way to track whose documents were included in the boxes and admitted that he did not know how many records had gone missing. Yokomizo said that there would be no way to contact all of the potential victims, but told KNBC-TV that to prevent further incidents, a chain-link fence would be constructed around the dumpster area.
 
 March 2006, Hamilton County Clerk of Courts (OH): Federal prosecutors discovered that identity thieves who allegedly stole $500,000 over four years obtained Social Security numbers needed to commit the thefts from a Hamilton County website. According to an investigation by The Cincinnati Enquirer, the website contained thousands of government documents including tax returns and parking citations which contained personal identifying information such as addresses and Social Security numbers. In 2004, the newspaper reported that the county clerk’s website was under scrutiny for posting the private information. The county clerk’s office said that they were public documents, and no laws prevented them from posting the information online. The office has changed its policy, and removed the private identifying information from its website, which according to the County Clerk, gets 60 million hits a year.
 
 March 2006, Fidelity Investments (Boston, MA): The largest mutual fund manager in the country said that a laptop containing the personal information including names, addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers for close to 196,000 Hewlett Packard retirement account customers was stolen in March 2006. Fidelity Investments, the provider of HP’s 401(k) and pension plans said that they regretted any inconveniences caused by the theft and said that they would be providing free credit monitoring services to affected individuals. Additionally, the Boston-based investment firm said that it would reimburse account holders if any unauthorized transactions were made as a result of the stolen laptop. The incident provides a troubling example of how highly sensitive information increasingly can be found on employee laptops.
 
 March 2006, Georgia Technology Authority: A hacker used “sophisticated hacking tools” to break into a Georgia Technology Authority database in March 2006 prompting GTA officials to send out 180,000 written notices to Georgia pension plan recipients. The state does not have contact information for the remaining 373,000 people affected by the breach and is hoping to alert them through media and other outreach. The hacker accessed the main server which contained names, Social Security numbers and bank account information for pension recipients sometime between Feb. 21 and Feb 23. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into the breach, and the authority has brought in outside security experts to identify vulnerabilities in its infrastructure. This breach follows an incident in 2005 in which an employee downloaded confidential information on 450,000 members of the state’s health plan on a home computer.
 
 April 2006, University of Texas, McCombs School of Business:
 197,000 current, prospective, alumni and faculty of the McCombs School of Business at University of Texas were alerted in late April that a hacker had accessed their private information from databases maintained by the school. UT President William Powers Jr. encouraged everyone in the business school to guard against identity theft by keeping a watchful eye on their credit files and taking action against any illegitimate transactions. Powers said that names, biographical information, some Social Security numbers and birthdays were accessed by the hacker. University officials believed that the source of the breach was a computer in the Far East.
 
 April 2006, Ohio University: Hackers breached an Ohio University computer server and had access to the personal information of 137,000 people for a year or longer, said a senior university administrator. This, and four other data breaches at the University, left close to 300,000 alumni, patients of the school’s health center, and employees vulnerable to identity theft. An FBI and university investigation indicated that names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, intellectual property files and medical information had been accessed by domestic and international hackers. The school responded by sending e-mail notifications to students and other individuals and encouraged potential identity theft victims to monitor their credit records.
 
 April 2006, Ohio’s Secretary of State: CD-ROMs containing the private information of “potentially millions of registered voters” in Ohio were erroneously sent out by the Secretary of State’s office to 20 political campaign operations in April 2006. The CDs contained Social Security numbers for many of Ohio’s 7.7 million voters whose records were contained on the CDs. A spokesman for the Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell said that the problem was brought to light after one of the campaign offices alerted the Secretary of State’s office to the sensitive information on the discs. The CDs were subsequently recalled, and replaced with discs which did not contain the social security numbers.
 
 May 2006, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants:
 In May 2006, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) reported that a damaged hard drive containing unencrypted personal information on 330,000 individuals such as names, addresses and Social Security numbers failed to return from a data-recovery service. AICPA said that the repaired hard drive was sent out by the service via FedEx, but the institute never received the package by its anticipated delivery date. A spokesman for FedEx said that his company was conducting an investigation into the missing package. AICPA offered a free year-long credit monitoring service to its members whose information was potentially compromised, and said that the missing information didn’t appear to have been misused. The institute also decided to delete all Social Security numbers from its member database.
 
 May 2006, U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs: In May 2006, the Veterans Affairs Department reported that a laptop and hard drive containing sensitive information for about 26.5 million veterans had been stolen from a staff analyst’s home. The stolen equipment contained unencrypted names, social security numbers, birthdates and health information. The VA staffer had been authorized by the administration to take the laptop and personal information to work from home. This revelation created a firestorm of scrutiny for the VA, who had been previously under fire for lax security practices dating back to 1997. In response to the theft, Veterans Affairs Secretary R. James Nicholson announced that the VA would be providing complimentary credit monitoring to veterans and encouraged them to review their credit report to identify signs of identity theft. In June 2006, both the laptop and hard drive were recovered by authorities. An FBI computer forensic search showed that none of the information had been accessed. To date, no cases of identity theft have been reported stemming from the VA personal data breach, but the incident has underscored the need for tighter data security practices at government agencies.
 
 May 2006, American Red Cross (St. Louis, MO): Sensitive information including names, Social Security numbers and dates of birth were stolen by a deceitful American Red Cross employee in the St. Louis region placing upwards of one million blood donors at risk of identity theft. The employee, who is now facing three counts of aggravated identity theft and one case of credit card fraud, opened credit cards using the stolen information of three donors. Authorities suspect that the employee, who worked as a telephone operator for five months, had access to a million names and Social Security numbers of blood donors. In a press release, the Red Cross notified the at-risk donors through writing and suggested that fraud alerts be placed on their credit records. To prevent further instances of theft and misuse by Red Cross employees, the blood center said that it would be restricting access to Social Security numbers and reminding staff that donors are not required to furnish their numbers.
 
 May 2006, Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corporation: Texas Guaranteed employees worked through the Memorial Day weekend identifying the 1.3 million borrowers whose names and social security numbers were lost by a contractor building the company’s document management system. The contractor, Toronto-based Hummingbird Ltd., said that it was searching for the unidentified piece of equipment that contained the private information, which was unencrypted. Company president and chief executive Barry Litwin said that the information was password protected and that it was unlikely that someone would maliciously use the information. Despite this, Texas Guaranteed notified the 1.3 million borrowers by mail soon after identifying the borrowers who were at risk.
 
 June 2006, Ernst & Young: Approximately a quarter million hotels.com customers are at heightened risk of identity theft after a thief stole a laptop from the trunk of a car belonging to the online hotel specialist’s auditor, Ernst & Young. The laptop was unencrypted and contained the names and credit card numbers for 243,000 customers who booked with the website from 2002 to 2004. A spokesman for the accounting firm said that the computer was password protected and that there was no proof that the information had been accessed or misused. He added that the company has taken precautions to prevent additional thefts by encrypting other laptops. Both hotels.com and Ernst & Young said that it would provide free credit monitoring services to affected customers for a year.
 
 June 2006, Denver Election Commission: Denver elections officials are still looking for a filing cabinet containing microfilm with personal information for 60,000 voters. The cabinet went missing after the Denver Election Commission moved into a new building. Movers hired by the commission noticed the file cabinet in the old building, but when they returned the next day ready to transport it to the new facility, it had disappeared. Executive director John Gaydeski vowed to “search every square inch of that building” until the cabinet was found, but so far it hasn’t yielded any results. City officials have contacted the voters whose information was lost and suggested that fraud alerts be placed on their credit accounts. The missing records included such sensitive information as names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, signatures and addresses. A week earlier, election officials recovered 87,000 microfilm files in a plastic box at the Commission’s old offices after they were reportedly lost in February.
 
 June 2006, American Insurance Group (AIG): A laptop computer and file server containing personal information on close to a million people was stolen from an American Insurance Group (AIG) office in the Midwest during an apparent burglary. A computer server containing the sensitive information was taken along with other electronic devices in the office. The lost records included names, Social Security numbers and in some cases, medical records on an estimated 970,000 people. The",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,12.0,130000.0,13000000.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2019,Wilson County Memorial Hospital District dba Connally Memorial Medical Center,TX,Theft,Laptop,"Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville has acknowledged a data breach in April that compromised patients’ protected health information.
 
 The hospital is notifying patients of the security incident.
 
 In a statement Aug. 16, the hospital advised, “Connally Memorial takes the privacy and the security of its patients’ information very seriously, and it regrets any inconvenience this incident may have caused.”
 
 The Floresville hospital discovered on June 21 that “a very limited amount of electronic protected health information was affected by a laptop theft.” This followed the theft April 23 of a laptop belonging to a Connally Memorial business associate.
 
 An investigation by the laptop’s owner determined that protected information may have been stored in the memory of the laptop, which was password protected, but not encrypted. The business associate notified the hospital about the incident on June 21.
 
 Connally Memorial is mailing letters to patients affected by the incident. Patient information affected includes:
 
 •First and last name
 
 •Date of birth
 
 •Specialty referral information
 
 •Gender

2019,Wise Health System,TX,HACK,Email,"Wise Health System in Decatur, TX, has started sending notifications to patients to inform them that some of their protected health information (PHI) has been exposed as a result of a phishing attack. 35,899 patients have potentially been affected.
 
 The attack occurred on March 14, 2019. Several employees received phishing emails and some responded and disclosed their account credentials. The credentials were then used to gain access to the Employee Kiosk, where the attacker(s) attempted to reroute payroll direct deposits. Attempts were made to redirect approximately 100 direct deposit payments.
 
 Wise Health had policies in place that require a paper check to be printed for two successive payrolls following a change to direct deposit information. The checks were printed in the payroll on April 5 and the unusually high number of checks raised the alarm. Thanks to the two-check policy, the fraud was prevented and no payments were redirected. A system wide password change was immediately performed to lock out the attackers and two third-party forensic firms were hired to investigate the breach. The breach was also reported to the FBI.
 
 The sole purpose of the attack appears to have been to reroute direct deposits, although the stolen credentials would have allowed access to be gained to employee email accounts. Those accounts contained patients’ names, medical record numbers, diagnostic information, treatment information, and health insurance information.
 
 Wise Health System does not believe PHI was accessed by the attackers and no reports have been received which suggest any patient information has been misused. Both forensics firms and the FBI share that point of view. The investigators all agreed they have never seen a direct deposit attack such as this where the attackers have stolen patient data. These gangs specialize in direct deposit fraud. The attackers in this case were traced to Africa by the FBI, which has now closed its investigation.
 
 Since unauthorized PHI access and data theft could not be ruled out, to ensure patients are protected, notification letters were sent on July 12, 2019 and affected patients have been offered a 12 month complimentary membership to ID Experts MyIDCare service (Credit monitoring, Identity theft recovery, and insurance coverage).
 
 Wise Health System is reviewing its security policies and procedures and will be taking steps to reinforce security. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Phishing Attack on Wise Health Impacts Data of 36,000 Patients
 Several employees of Wise Health fell victim to phishing attempts in March, which gave hackers their login credentials; a “password spray attack” completes this week’s breach roundup. July 19, 2019 - Washington-based Wise Health System is notifying 35,899 patients that their data was potentially breached after several employees fell victim to phishing attacks in March.
 
 On March 14, hackers launched a targeted email phishing campaign against the health system. According to officials, a few employees were duped by the malicious emails and, as a result, provided the hacker with their usernames and passwords.
 
 Once the cybercriminals obtained the credentials, they used the information to access the employee kiosk in an attempt to divert direct payroll deposits. Officials stressed they do not believe the attackers were attempting to view patient data, but rather obtain employees’ direct deposits.

 However, as patient data was included in the compromised accounts, officials are notifying patients of the security incident. Officials said access to the email accounts could have potentially exposed patient data like medical record numbers, diagnostic and treatment data, and insurance information.
 
 All impacted patients will receive a year of identity theft protection services. The notification did not explain the delayed notification. Under HIPAA, providers are required to report breaches to the Department of Health and Human services on 60 days from discovery.
 
 Since the incident, Wise Health has reviewed and updated its security policies and procedures. Officials said they’ve also worked with forensics computer experts to investigate the incident and reported the breach to law enforcement.
 
 EDGEPARK MEDICAL SUPPLIES REPORTS “PASSWORD SPRAY ATTACK”
 RGH Enterprises, doing business as Edgepark Medical Supplies, recently fell victim to a “password spray attack”, which potentially breached the information of 6,572 customers. Edgepark is a home-delivered medical product supplier in the US.
 
 According to officials, Edgepark discovered the shipping address listed in a small number of customers’ Edgepark.com accounts were altered. As a result, the orders from the impacted accounts were being shipped to a different address than what was entered by the customer.
 
 Officials temporarily disabled online access to the user accounts and launched an investigation. They found some accounts had been targeted with a sophisticated cyberattack known as a “password spray attack,” where a hacker repeatedly attempts to guess the users’ credentials, often through an automated process.
 
 As a result, officials said it’s possible the hackers accessed some customer accounts without authorization and potentially viewed or access the customers’ names, dates of birth, addresses, products purchased through Edgepark, and health insurance information.
 
 Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and other financial data were not compromised.
 
 All customers whose accounts were identified as having experience unusual activity by Edgepark’s security team are being notified. However, officials said customers who detect unusual behavior should contact Edgepark. Officials have or will process refunds to customers who were erroneously charged as a result of the breach.
 
 Law enforcement has been notified, and Edgepark is implementing additional security controls to lessen the likelihood of a repeat event.",1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,21.0,35899.0,3589900.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
2012,Women and Infant's Hospital,RI,Loss,Other,"The breach at Women and Infants Hospital, which involved lost back-up tapes, potentially exposed patient names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, dates of exams, physicians' names and ultrasound images.
 
 ""Personal information and protected health information must be properly safeguarded by hospitals and other healthcare entities,"" says Martha Coakley, the state's attorney general. ""This data breach put thousands of Massachusetts consumers at risk, and it is the hospital's responsibility to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.""
 
 As part of the agreement, the hospital has agreed to take several steps, including maintaining an up-to-date inventory of the locations, custodians and descriptions of unencrypted electronic media and paper patient charts containing personal information and protected health information, authorities say. The hospital has also agreed to perform a review and audit of security measures and to take any corrective measures recommended in the review.
 
 The financial settlement breaks down to a $110,000 civil penalty, $25,000 for attorneys' fees and costs, and a payment of $15,000 to a fund to be used by the attorney general's office to promote education concerning the protection of personal information and protected health information and a fund for future data security litigation.
 
 The attorney general's office says it's focused on ensuring that healthcare organizations and their business associates abide by the state's data security laws and federal data privacy requirements under HIPAA and the HITECH Act.
 
 The breach is included on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights' list of breaches affecting 500 or more individuals.
 
 A spokesperson for the Rhode Island attorney general said the office did not file suit against the hospital because it notified impacted individuals and offered one year of free credit monitoring services, ""which goes above and beyond what the statute requires corporations to do,"" she said. ""The office was satisfied with the proactive steps Women and Infants [took] in offering patients that free credit monitoring.""
 
 Breach Details
 In April 2012, the hospital discovered it was missing 19 unencrypted back-up tapes from two of its prenatal diagnostic centers, one located in Providence, R.I., and the other located in New Bedford, Mass., authorities say.
 
 Those tapes were supposed to have been sent in the summer of 2011 to a central data center at Women and Infants Hospital's parent company, Care New England Health System, and then shipped off site in order to transfer legacy radiology information to a new picture archiving and communications system, according to authorities.
 
 Due to an inadequate inventory and tracking system, the hospital allegedly did not discover the tapes were missing until the spring of 2012, Massachusetts authorities say. They say deficient employee training and internal policies resulted in the breach not being properly reported to the Massachusetts attorney general and to consumers until the fall of 2012.
 @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@As we have repeatedly noted, identity theft is a multi-billion dollar problem. Many companies have responded to this threat by upgrading their security procedures. However, some companies continue to put their customers at risk and patients. The Rhode Island-based Women & Infants Hospital just announced that it has exposed the confidential medical and personal information of 14,000 patients.
 
 The exposed information may include Social Security numbers and sensitive medical information. Disclosure of personal information and medical information is unlawful, and we have brought lawsuits on behalf of victims of such disclosures in the TRICARE/SAIC, Zappos, Sutter Health and Saint Joseph data breaches. If you were a patient at Women & Infants Hospital, and you believe your private information has been misused, please contact us immediately to discuss your legal options.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A Rhode Island hospital, which nearly two years ago notified 14,000 patients of a HIPAA breach, agreed July 23 to hand over $150,000 to settle allegations that it failed to safeguard patient information.A Rhode Island hospital, which nearly two years ago notified 14,000 patients of a HIPAA breach, agreed July 23 to hand over $150,000 to settle allegations that it failed to safeguard patient information. 
 
 The Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island, or WIH, will pay the civil penalty to the Massachusetts Attorney General who slapped the hospital with a lawsuit after discovering 12,127 of those patients were Massachusetts residents. 
 
 The HIPAA breach, which was reported in September 2012 despite occurring in the spring, involved 19 unencrypted back-up tapes that went missing. Contained on the tapes were patient names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, ultrasound images, dates of exams and physicians' names. 
 
 ""Personal information and protected health information must be properly safeguarded by hospitals and other healthcare entities,"" Massachusetts AG Martha Coakley said, in a prepared statement. ""This data breach put thousands of Massachusetts consumers at risk, and it is the hospital's responsibility to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.""
 
 Following an investigation, officials discovered the backup tapes were originally supposed to be mailed to a central data center and subsequently shipped off-site to transfer legacy radiology data to a new PACS.
 
 However, due to an ""inadequate inventory and tracking system,"" reportedly, hospital officials did not learn of the missing tapes until spring 2012. Inadequate employee training and lacking internal policies also contributed to the breach not being properly reported, according to AG officials. 
 
 Settlement terms require WIH to maintain an up-to-date inventory of locations, custodians and descriptions of unencrypted devices containing PHI. It also will need to perform regular security audits and take subsequent actions according to findings. 
 
 Of the $150,000 settlement, WIH will pay a $110,000 civil penalty, $25,000 for attorney fees and $15,000 to a fund to be used by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office to promote education concerning the protection of personal information and PHI and a fund for future data security litigation. 
 
 The Massachusetts Attorney General's office has a history of enforcement regarding healthcare data breaches. 
 
 In 2012, it hit South Shore Hospital with a $750,000 settlement after the hospital failed to safeguard the data of 800,000 patients after 472 boxes of unencrypted backup tapes went missing. 
 
 In January 2013, former owners of a medical billing practice and four pathology groups handed over $140,000 to settle breach allegations after groups dumped the medical records of 67,000 patients at a public transfer station.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,365.0,26000.0,2600000.0,1.0,150000.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

Organizations of all sizes need to be aware of the potential threats and be willing to invest in options that will help keep sensitive data secure.
 
 Ohio-based Wood County Hospital averted a potentially widespread ransomware attack by detecting the issue with the help of its managed security services provider (MSSP) two weeks before it surfaced.
 
 CIO Joanne White said the organization had been wanting to increase its security by adding network traffic analytics.
 
 Wood County Hospital has 19 clinics it supports, White explained to HealthITSecurity.com. There are 16 people in IT who supports all of those locations. Wood County utilizes Cerner for its hospital EMR and NextGen in the clinics, she added.
 
 The ransomware incident took place in September 2016, which is when an employee received a popup message that said files had been encrypted and that Wood County had 72 hours to pay.

 “We had been doing a proof of concept with ExtraHop,” White recalled, adding that preconfigured reports and dashboards were already prebuilt with ExtraHop. “We had done a proof of concept, collecting data, and we were looking at things for the new fiscal year. It was still collecting data in the background, but we hadn't looked at it since ExtraHop had done a call with us to review the details of our testing period.”
 
 White added that Wood County immediately contacted ExtraHop after the ransomware was first discovered, asking if Wood County could access the reports in the system to determine what was happening.
 
 “The first thing we saw was one PC that was sending pings all over our entire network,” White said. “It was just flooding our internal network, so we focused on that machine. The first thing we did was we pulled it off the network. Then we brought it over into IT and we looked through the others.”
 
 Wood County dug into the ExtraHop logs to see the anomalies, she continued. The organization also uses Veriato 360 to view keystrokes. 
 
 “From the logs that we were able to locate through ExtraHop, we saw the timestamp on the ransomware file,” White explained. “We looked at [Veriato 360] for that timeframe and we were able to pinpoint exactly where the ransomware came in the system.”

 “It was a nurse in behavioral health who had clicked on a website that she goes to on a frequent basis for her job,” she continued. “It was at the minute she clicked on a link in their website that the ransomware entered our system.”
 
 Wood County was able to isolate the device from the main network, along with terminal services that the computer had connected to. White added that Wood County ran scans and continued to work with ExtraHop to ensure that the ransomware did not spread.
 
 “We found 47 instances of the infected directory that could not propagate due to no admin rights,” White stated. “We had 47 executables waiting to take off. Can you imagine how we were feeling at that point, knowing what a disaster it could have been?”
 
 “At that point we reimaged the PC,” White added. “We reimaged the server. We deleted [the employee’s] user profile, and of course deleted her user directory. We created new ones and we set up scans and alerts in ExtraHop.”
 
 The ransomware was a new strain called CryptFile2. The message stated that decrypting the Wood County files was only possible with the necessary private key and decrypt program, which was on a “Secret Server.”

 “So, there are two ways you can choose: wait for a miracle and get your price doubled, or start send email now for more specific instructions! , and restore your data easy way,” read the message, a copy of which was given to HealthITSecurity.com. “If You have really valuable data, you better not waste your time, because there is no other way to get your files, except make a payment.”
 
 Since implementing ExtraHop, White explained that real-time alerts are extremely helpful in determining potential issues.
 
 “One day we got an alert that a user in support service was accessing the files that were known to be a security risk,” she said. “We found out that a new employee was trying to access some really old files. But they had been files where the extensions had been renamed, and that set off the flags. The files were fine, but we've gotten a number of alerts since then. We can follow up on them quickly.”
 
 There is no way to ensure 100 percent that no cybersecurity issues will ever happen, White stressed. But there are ways to work on keeping your systems as secure as possible, and implement an applicable recovery plan.
 
 “As soon as they find a way to stop it, someone thinks of another way to get in or infect your system,” she maintained. “But at least now I feel like we'll get alerted and be able to react promptly. You're reading a lot of reports right now on people who are finding that they had this in their system for years. Or people will find that it spreads throughout their network and cripples their system.”
 
 Wood County has firewalls, antivirus software, URL filtering, and sandboxing, White said. It also utilizes email filtering, encryption, and a SIEM log management for vulnerability scans.
 
 “We have quite a few things in place, but there is always the possibility of a perfect storm,” she stated. “We do a lot of end user education here. We're also much more keenly aware of our patch management. We have vulnerability assessments that we do every month.”
 
 White added that Wood County is very lucky to have a CEO who understood the importance of what happened and why it was so necessary to make the investment in ExtraHop.
 
 “He let us purchase it immediately,” she said. “He didn’t make us wade through the budget.”
 
 Since the ransomware incident, White added that Wood County has stepped up its security. Email reminders are sent out to employees with real-time examples. Staff members were informed that a vulnerability had been detected that was instigated by a user clicking on a link on a website.
 
 Educating employees on the importance of being aware of potential phishing scams or ransomware attacks is essential, she stressed, and is an important part of security training.
 
 “I am just very grateful that we were able to stop it, and we had thought about security before,” she concluded. “I'm really grateful that we had that insight into the network – internal network that could help us find it so quickly and react to it. Otherwise I felt like we were sitting on a ticking time bomb. I hope I don't have to go through that again.”",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,5.0,2500.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
2013,Woodwinds Hospital,MN,INSD,Other,"Financial disputes may underlie some vendors retaining patient or client data – as in the Kaiser Permanente/Surefile Filing Systems case I’ve blogged about on this site or the Irvine Scientific breach I described on DataBreaches.net. But there are other possible motivations for not relinquishing or taking data as well. Maura Lerner of the Star Tribune reports on a case in Minnesota where an employee took copies of records home and kept them, allegedly as proof of wrongdoing by the hospital:
 
 Three years ago, Barbara Peterson walked out of Woodwinds Hospital in Woodbury with more than 200 pages of confidential patient files.
 
 On that much, everyone agrees.
 
 Now those files are at the heart of a federal lawsuit, in which Peterson accuses the hospital of trying to cover up evidence of medical misconduct.
 
 Peterson, who was a patient advocate at Woodwinds, claims that she was ordered to destroy notes and e-mails about incidents that could damage the hospital’s reputation — including an allegation that a doctor was drunk while delivering a baby. She says she took the documents home to protect them.
 
 The hospital says that her version of events “simply did not happen.” And it accuses Peterson of violating patient privacy by walking off with — and refusing to return — hospital records. Woodwinds fired her in 2010 before the missing documents came to light.@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@$2M Settlement Reached in Cottage Health Data Breach Case

  By Elizabeth Snell
 
 November 27, 2017 - Cottage Health System recently reached a $2 million settlement with the California Attorney General’s office after two separate health data breach incidents that took place in 2013 and 2015.
 
 In total, more than 50,000 patients had their medical information publicly available from the data breaches.
 
 “When patients go to a hospital to seek medical care, the last thing they should have to worry about is having their personal medical information exposed,” Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “The law requires health care providers to protect patients' privacy. On both of these counts, Cottage Health failed.”

 The first incident took place in 2013 when Cottage was notified that a company server containing medical records for over 50,000 patients was connected to the internet without encryption, password protection, firewalls, or permissions that would have prevented unauthorized access.
 
 Exposed information included medical history, diagnosis, laboratory test results, and medications.
 
 Two years later, Cottage experienced a second health data breach while the state attorney general was investigating the 2013 incident. In the second Cottage health data breach, 4,596 patient records were accessible online for approximately two weeks. This incident involved PII and ePHI, including medical record numbers, account numbers, names, addresses, Social Security Numbers, employment information, admit and discharge dates, and other personal information.
 
 “Cottage’s data breaches were symptoms of its system-wide data security failures,” stated the conformed complaint against Cottage. “Cottage failed to employ basic security safeguards, leaving vulnerable software unpatched or out-of-date, using default or weak passwords, and lacking sufficient perimeter security, among many other problems.”
 
 The complaint also explained that the security assessments following the first data breach revealed that Cottage’s external and internal information systems were “significantly compromised.”
 
 “Cottage was running outdated software, failing to apply software patches, not resetting default configurations, not using strong passwords, failing to limit access to sensitive PII, and failing to conduct regular risk assessments, among other things,” the document read.
 
 The data breach from 2015 also involved a server that was internet-accessible and was not protected with a firewall, the complaint maintained. Misconfigured server settings reportedly led to the server being accessed “by a limited number of other unidentified parties.”
 
 Along with paying the $2 million penalty, Cottage must also upgrade its data security practices, according to the California Attorney General.
 
 “Cottage Health is required to protect patients’ medical information from unauthorized access and disclosure and to maintain an information security program that meets reasonable security practices and procedures for the healthcare industry,” the attorney general statement said. “It must designate an employee to serve in the capacity of a Chief Privacy Officer and to complete periodic risk assessments.”
 
 Specifically, Cottage must “maintain reasonable security practices and procedures to protect patients’ medical information from unauthorized access and/or disclosure, including access by or via internet search engines,” the California court’s final judgement explained.
 
 Cottage will also need to ensure its information security program does the following:
 
 Assess hardware and software used within Cottage’s computer network for potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patients’ medical information, and updating security settings and access controls where appropriate
 Evaluate the response to and protections from external threats, including firewall security
 Encrypt patients’ medical information in transit in accordance with health care industry best practices
 Maintain reasonable policies and protocols for all information practices regarding data retention, internal audits, security incident tracking reports, risk assessments, incident management, and remediation plan
 Conduct periodic vulnerability/penetration testing designed to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities within Cottage’s computer network
 Train employees regarding the collection, use, and storage of patients’ medical information.
 The healthcare organization is also required to complete an annual privacy risk assessment for the next two years. Cottage will explain how it is addressing its compliance with applicable privacy laws over PHI security and on the effectiveness of its information security program.

 In the last four years, approximately 250 million records containing personal identifying information of United States residents stored in government and corporate databases was either lost or stolen. Since little attention was given to database breaches prior to 2005, it is safe to assume that every man, woman and child has had their personal information exposed at least once statistically. In fact, many citizens have received multiple notification letters informing them that their personal information has been placed in jeopardy.
 
 While most security breach notification letters will insist there is no evidence the breach has resulted in any harm, there is a growing body of evidence that personal information lost or stolen from databases is being used by identity thieves to commit crimes involving identity fraud. 
 
 If you receive a notice that your personal information has been lost or stolen, insist the notifying entity provide at least one year of free monitoring of your credit report. Additionally, please review the information provided in our ID Theft Prevention, Protection and Recovery categories in order to further preserve and protect your identity.

2018,Yale University,CT,Unauthorized Disclosure,Paper/Films,"Two lawsuits have been filed in federal court against Yale University. Both lawsuits are claiming damages from a 2008 data breach at Yale, which was discovered earlier this year.
 
 Between April 2008 and January 2009, intruders gained access to a Yale database and gathered names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, email addresses, and in some cases, physical addresses.
 
 In a letter to those affected by the data breach, Yale said the breach was discovered on June 16, 2018, during a security review of its servers. After the university discovered the breach, it notified those affected and offered credit monitoring services and identity theft prevention tips.
 
 
 
 A class-action lawsuit filed this week on behalf of Andrew Mason of Virginia claims that Yale was negligent in its handling of student data and that the university was reckless and acted with “willful misconduct” as it “turned a blind eye to” possibilities of a prior data breach. It also claims that the university used unfair trade practices.
 
 A federal lawsuit on behalf of Julie Mason of New York was filed in August. The lawsuit also claims negligence, willful misconduct, recklessness and unfair trade practices. In addition, it claims that Yale had still not notified everyone who was affected as of Aug. 1, six weeks after discovering the data breach.
 
 The breach affected an estimated 119,000 Yale alumni, faculty and staff, according to the lawsuits. One of the lawsuits claims that the breach affected a far broader group of people than initially identified by Yale, and that Yale did not make people aware that this type of their personal data had been stored.
 
 In its letter to those affected, Yale said that the university had deleted personal information from the affected database in 2011 as part of a data protection program, but had not detected the data breach at that time.
 
 “Yale takes seriously the protection of personal information, and we continue to improve our electronic security and eliminate the unnecessary storage of such information,” the university’s statement to those affected read. “We very much regret this incident and the inconvenience to you.”
 @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Around 20 years ago, Julie Mason submitted her social security number, among other personal information, to Yale as part of an application for a visiting student program. Now, Mason — who never received a degree from Yale — is suing the University after it was revealed that she, along with more than 100,000 others, was affected by a data breach that took place almost a decade ago.
 
 Between 2008 and 2009, hackers breached a University database and extracted names, social security numbers and — in some cases — dates of birth, email addresses and physical addresses. The data, which included the personal information of about 119,000 people, was deleted from University servers in September 2011, when administrators were still unaware that the hacking had taken place.
 
 It was not until June 2018 that the University became aware of the breach, during a security review of its servers. In July, Yale emailed the affected individuals to inform them of the breach. Just a few days later, Mason and more than 100 others — whose collective damages due to the breach exceed $5,000,000 — launched a class-action lawsuit against the University, according to court documents. The suit alleges that Yale failed to comply with existing privacy regulations.
 
 “As a result of the data breach, Ms. Mason has suffered substantial harm,” the complaint reads. “As a direct and proximate result of Yale’s deceptive and unlawful acts and practices, Plaintiff and New York Subclass members have suffered and will continue to suffer injury, ascertainable loss of money or property, and monetary and non-monetary damages.”
 
 Mason’s lawyer declined to comment. It’s unclear from the complaint whether she attended the program at Yale, and a representative from the law firm representing her declined to confirm whether she did. A University spokeswoman said Yale would not comment on pending litigation.
 
 In the complaint, Mason states that the University deceptively assured her that her information would be protected. In addition to damages, Mason and the other plaintiffs are demanding that Yale maintain appropriate data protection practices and disclose in a timely and accurate manner whether a breach has occurred.
 
 In 2014, the complaint states, $60,000 was taken from one of Mason’s bank accounts — as a result of stolen data from the breach of Yale’s servers, she claims. Using her personal information, the perpetrators of the theft were also able to change the password to Mason’s online banking account over the telephone. And Mason’s credit card accounts were also compromised, forcing her to pay to mail credit freeze requests to all three major credit reporting agencies.
 
 In the July emails explaining the breach, the University stated that “members of the Yale community” had been impacted. However, Mason is not a Yale alumna, nor has she ever served as a faculty or staff member.
 
 Michael Fischer, a Yale professor and expert in data breaches whose information was also hacked, said University administrators were not sufficiently aware of threats to campus security in 2009, when the incident occurred. The University did not create the chief information security officer position until 2011, months after 43,000 social security numbers belonging to Yale community members were found to be discoverable on Google in another incident.
 
 David Opderbeck, an expert in cybersecurity and technology law at Seton Hall Law School, said higher-education institutions are especially vulnerable to data breaches because of the massive number of sensitive records they store, as well as the many points of access to that information in University databases. Higher education institutions have lagged behind corporations in terms of data privacy precautions, he added.
 
 Gary Schober, a lawyer who works in cybersecurity, said that while cases like the one against Yale are usually resolved through settlements, the plaintiffs will first have to prove that the damages occurred specifically as a result of the breach.
 
 “The clear lesson here is not hold information you don’t really need,” Schober said. “There was absolutely no reason for Yale to have information on somebody who might have applied to the school a long time before the breach or collected in some other context when Yale really didn’t need the information anymore.”
 
 Yale is offering a year of identity monitoring services to U.S. residents affected by the data breach.",1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,60.0,1102.0,110200.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

 One victim of the identity theft who was being hospitalized for a brain injury told NBC she felt the two companions, or ""sitters,"" were targeting patients they thought would die in the hospital. According to the court filings, the two sitters would change their alleged victims' addresses, then monitor their mail to gain access to their financial information, ultimately opening credit cards in the patients' names.
 
 According to NBC, in one instance, one of the alleged identity thieves made themselves the beneficiary of a $50,000 life insurance policy for an individual hospitalized for behavioral health reasons.
 
 One of the women faces bank fraud and aggravated identity theft charges, while the other faces a charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, according to the filing. Hospital officials told NBC they are cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's office and federal investigators and that the woman who worked as a companion is no longer employed at Yale-New Haven. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@A 37-year-old former Yale-New Haven Hospital employee was sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to charges connected to an identity fraud and identity case that authorities said affected more than 30 people.

 According to court documents, Jamila Williams-Stevenson, 37, of West Haven, worked with 43-year-old Lorena Coburn, of West Haven, between 2012 and July 2016 to steal people's information, which included patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital where Williams-Stevenson worked as a care companion.
